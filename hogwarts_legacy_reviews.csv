0,16,Greattt Game!
1,26,"9/10Fantastic experience. A true Wizarding World experience. Play it and experience it, the castle alone is the worth it. And thats only a third of the game."
2,29,worth it
3,24,I've been waiting 84 YEARSSSSSSSS.The game is everything I could have hoped for and more.
4,7,very fun game (it is not transphobic at all)
5,8,Better than expected! But bad optimization.
6,0,Garbage
7,3,Full of surprises!
8,2,Fun Harry Potter Game! My sister and I Enjoyed it.
9,15,One of the best games I have bought in my recent memory
10,29,"Denuvo Anti-Tampering makes the game stutter, same as every other game that adopts this cancer."
11,21,very fun
12,38,"I have awaited this game for a over a decade, and I wasn't disappointed. Quite an achievement."
13,56,The best game of the year
14,8,Very aesthetically made game
15,4,"Love the game! I needed to upgrade my graphics card and more RAM, but now that I'm all set up, it's great!"
16,54,Excellent game
17,10,Great game. Love all the little details to make this game come alive
18,19,I no watch harry potter movies but being wizard fun. Good game. Make DLC
19,8,7/10 - my immersion is somewhat broken by the fact that 18th century Scotland school has 90% of the professors and more than half of the students with foreign accent. How many are there in the movies? And that's 20th century
20,12,After a long time I've spent so much time on a Single-Player Game. I am seriously hooked on it. I am looking forward to further content for this game.
21,21,it looks amazing
22,30,"I love this game, despite completing the story there is tons more to do :) Secretly hoping that, at a later date, there will be further progression where you becoming a working member of the ministry with new stories/missions :)"
23,2,The visuals in the game are stunning.  There are numerous character customization options.  I play on a PC and don't recommend using a keyboard if you have a controller.
24,11,awesome game 10/10
25,10,HOGWARTS + RPG = EXCELLENT
26,12,"there were major performance issues to start with, but they seem to have been mostly fixed. Overall a great AAA game!"
27,20,Game is a blast whether you liked HP or not. Choice is an illusion as all outcomes are predetermined and the story isn't spectacular but the other aspects of the game more than make up for it. Solid 9/10
28,12,Game of the decade
29,9,"Got to borrow the game, 100% lived up to the hype I had for it! Would recommend if you have the money and enjoy a good harry potter experience"
30,14,"Hogwarts Legacy is a very mediocre, generic and formulaic modern open world game that's saved from being a bad game by the Harry Potter license. They've done a good job of recreating Hogwarts and it is honestly really cool being able to fly around and above the castle on your broom seamlessly. I had fun in my first several hours playing the game just exploring the castle and the areas outside around the castle like hogsmeade. The more you progress though the more you realise how little the game has to offer. One of the biggest offenders is how lifeless the world feels with the lack of interaction in general. I compare it to Bully which came out 17 years ago now. When you walk around the school in Bully it feels like you are a part of that world. There is a time mechanic where you need to get to class on time and go to bed on time etc. All the NPC's have their routine they're following making you feel like the world is moving regardless of you being there rather than it feeling like the world is waiting for you like it does in Hogwarts Legacy. The difference between the level of interaction compared to a game released in 2006 is honestly really sad but that's just one of my many complaints. The general lack of role playing is also a big issue, you don't feel like a student in this world at all. You go to class like less than a dozen times from what i recall just to learn spells so you can go on mass killings in the world. The story and writing in general is lackluster, lack of well written characters to latch on to and connect with to pull you through the story. Main character has no personality. No consequences for your actions and choices have zero impact on the outcome in the end. Combat gets extremely repetitive and tiresome. The R2/RT spam is ridiculous i felt like i was on autopilot throughout most of the combat. The lack of enemy variety didn't help either. The gear system is terrible because of the level scaling making exploration pointless knowing you will never find a really good item that will last you dozens of hours because everything is scaled to your level. There is nothing interesting to see outside of Hogwarts and Hogsmeade because of all the bland check list side activities they've added to pad out the length. Boring level and puzzle design in the caves and dungeons. UI feels like it's ripped straight out of a modern Ubisoft game. Graphics are inconsistent, sometimes it looks like a good looking PS4 game and other times it looks like an early PS3 game. The performance is awful because of the amount of VRAM it uses, i had to find a fix online for my RTX 3070 8gb because it ate all my VRAM like it was nothing. Maybe it's justified if the game looked amazing but it doesn't. The game overall doesn't feel like it's a full price Triple A game, it feels like a budget title. Makes sense that the developers last game was Cars 3. 4/10 (Mediocre)"
31,23,"I am in love with this game! There is so much to see, do and explore! The graphics are amazing even though there were some glitches in Hogsmeade but they seem to have been resolved. Amazing game over all so far."
32,104,Most fun i've had in a game for years - and I'm not even a Potter fan.
33,18,no complaints. This is how you make a Harry Potter game!
34,24,fucking amazing
35,6,Loved it
36,29,"Amazing ""open"" magic world, the main story is a little shorter than expected. They can be a lots of other new features, but it is a must for any Wizarding World fan and for the non-fan too, it a nice and different game."
37,4,Great so far minus combat. This is dogshit
38,7,Amazing game
39,1,best game ever
40,0,"Tedious, slow, presumptuous, patronising and dull."
41,4,Im only about an hour into the game but it is a blast and i highly recommend this to anyone who has watch or is into harry potter and to those who may not be into it.
42,11,the game we have wanted for years

53,12,best game this Year yet
54,18,I am the most evil Hufflepuff known to man I am worse than Voldemort even. I'm so silly for using Avada Kedavra!
55,14,"Gameplay is super fun and story is interesting enough to keep going. Very ""light"" though, nothing to deep, really predictable.No morality system is kind of strange though..using dark arts should be punished somehow. This destroys the immersion for me."
56,32,"This game makes you really feel like a wizard, it has a little something for everyone, too much water 5/7."
57,5,good game
58,29,Absolutely fantastic game....Huge open world tons to do great story line.....Has a few bugs that need to be fixed like optimization issues....but overall great game.....

64,30,games's awsome buy it
65,6,Fantastic game! 10/10 would recommend for any potter fan out there. Ignore all the bs hate from idiots.
66,53,"I love this game. I'm not much of a fighter, so I play Easy mode, but it is so much to explore. The Hogwarts castle is magnificent and there are so many puzzles and things to find. And the magic is great."
67,20,Brilliant. Some stuttering but not game breaking. Very enjoyable
68,8,"Vroom, Vroom, Skirrrttt!"

76,4,"yeah, its pretty cool game"
77,19,"got in to a spiders cave and fell from a cliff, now my entire game got stuck mid air. It acts like i am with the mouse on an image, no reaction, I've hit all the buttons from my keyboard to get a move.From a to z and f1 to f12 not a single button got me unstuck.I am currently removing the game. Hoping uninstall/install will solve the issue."
78,2,Forget petting.. you can levitate and shoot every Cat in this game
79,34,just play it and stop reading comments

92,28,A very pretty game but shallow in execution
93,59,its great
94,2,"Performance is horrible, optimization was clearly not on the minds of the developers, a shame. Everything about this game is wonderful but just given the performance I cannot in good faith recommend this product. Refunded. Buy it on a console if you have the next-gen hardware, it's gonna save you a ton of headaches, mods aren't worth it here."
95,23,Awesome for someone with ADD
96,7,Good Game
97,18,It's like dream come true.NOT!! a very big fan of Harry Potter but have played older games and have always wondered how it would fell to have an open world game of it.It's an entirely different experience it's open world like other games but MAGICAL!!
98,16,Very good game!!
99,9,"Good contender for GOTY. Very addictive, and nastalgic. Worth the buy"
100,5,"Massive performance issue, needs patch - frequent fps drop to single digits and 20s. Good game otherwise"

116,10,"Lets start with the pros:- Hogwarts itself looks great, at times I felt like I was in a Harry Potter movie- Music is decent, they remixed the classic HP tunes- Graphics are decent to great- Voice acting is pretty goodBut unfortunately once you look past the surface, a lot of problems start to appear. Unless youre a blind fanboy. One of the biggest issue if not the biggest is the empty open world littered with completely pointless stuff like Merlin's Trials, Treasure Vaults etc. Stuff straight out of Ubisoft's book for ""How to Pad Your Game's Length"".It would be alright if for example the Merlin's Trials were like 8 trials total, all wildly different. Merlin's Trials are simple puzzles you have to complete in droves to unlock more of your very limited inventory space. After you've done 3 different Trials, you've done them all. Unfortunately there are over 90 of these goddamn trials.Treasure Vaults are like Merlin's Trials but even simpler and and the reward is opening a door in to a tiny ""dungeon"" (and I mean tiny, takes 5 seconds to reach the loot) where one piece of loot awaits you, usually just something trash (its all randomized so you can even savescum before opening any container)And there's tons of these, just littered everywhere. And you cant turn them off. When youre flying on your broom and press R to reveal nearby interesting locations, a huge mass of these icons pops up in your face and you just want to quit playing.Side quests are nearly all simple fetch quests, some dont even bother hiding it. I just currently got a literal fetch quest where I have to make a delivery in a far away place. I know I wont finish this quest.There are over 150 so called ""field guide pages"" to collect in Hogwarts alone. These net you XP which is needed to level up. 90% of the content in this game is Ubisoft style completely pointless garbage. And I really mean around 90%. 5% is fetch quests and actual good content is the remaining 5%, the main quests which are actually fun to play.Forget about anything interesting happening anywhere, the NPC's are all just as soulless as for example in Cyberpunk. There is no AI whatsoever. Forget even about stuff like for example in Witcher 3, where even small bandit hideout location often had a bit of attached lore in the form of a diary of their latest victim etc, just fleshing out the world. None of that here.I'm 17 hours in and I just have no interest playing anymore, its very formulaic, very tiresome, and apart from the occasional fun main questing, overwhelming majority of the content is braindead boring. And I didn't even mention the performance issues. They can fix the performance but they wont fix the game design choices made."
117,18,"Great game, badly optimized for PC though, may get better in the future"
118,27,amazing and absolutely astonishing
119,6,cracking open world game

124,2,Good game
125,31,ive been personally victimized by the merlin trials
126,18,"Its SO much fun! Don't let other people stop you from playing this if you want to. In todays world its not possible to be morally perfect in every decision you make. So buy the game, and be the witch or wizard you were always meant to be."
127,30,Great game with so many puzzles and secrets. Great way to realize a childhood dream.

139,46,Amazing game. Can spend hours in it.
140,13,The amount of effort and dedication the developers put into this game is astounding. This is the definition of what the gaming community needs. Games you can play over and over again... NOT the same game you can purchase over and over again.
141,43,game is a lot of fun best i played in a while
142,40,So magical
143,25,"Amazing game so far, so much to do, if only they'd included a bit of co-op, Qudditch and Wizards Chess it could be a contender for GOTY. excited for future DLC!"

147,21,"Amazing game and a must play! People are down-voting because of Rowling, but nobody that has played this game can deny that it's great!"
148,23,"Из плюсов: красивая, динамичная боевка.В целом паразитирующая на вселенной и именах консольная душнина с мертвым миром, безальтернативными квестами и скучнейшими персонажами."

150,6,The game is worth to buy
151,11,just finished the story in about 25 hours and still have a ton of content to play. currently writing this review after an 8 hour session. i bought the game impulsively and i do not regret it. great game.
152,19,Super Game aber bin zu Nett um Böse zu sein :c
153,52,As a transgender this game is very offensive.
154,2,"""Merlin's Beard"""
155,51,"Hogwarts Legacy will be the most overhyped and also the most boring game of the year.The immersion and role playing elements are absolute trash, I never once felt like a student as hogwarts as I was always wearing some goofy ass costume due to my gear. There is little to no interaction between mc and the other students and there are no minigames to play with them either. MC is a complete teachers pet regardless of what you want your character to be like and in that aspect it makes sense that the other students ignore you. There are zero consequences for your actions, so you can't be whatever you want to be as the story is set in stone, you can't fail anything either. You can use unforgivable curses as much as you want and nobody will give a shit.The progression in the game is also horrible. Around a third of the way into the game you unlock the ability to unlock locks and what you unlock is tier 1 of 3. Exploring before being able to unlock tier 3 locks is a waste of time as you'd have to backtrack just to get that one tier 3 lock. Gearing doesn't really matter at all and you just smack on whatever has the highest stats, you don't even need to upgrade any gear ever, the only thing gearing really does is make you look like a clown. There is a fashion system so you can change appearance to not look like a clown, but it resets whenever you equip new gear, so you might as well just stay as a clown. The game tells you that you start unlocking talent points from level 5, but you can't unlock a single talent before you're well over level 10. The talent points themselves are mostly useless due to the combat being extremely easy and the only good talent is increasing revelio range as you're spamming revelio constantly during your entire playthrough.The open world offers nothing interesting to do. There are a ton of merlin chores to increase your gear slots, but none of these offer any kind of challenge. I usually enjoy platforming, but the merlin chore platforming trial consists of jumping from one massive block to another that is right next to the other, they are impossible to fail. It's just so incredibly boring. There are also a bunch of caves and treasure vaults, but most of the time they are as follows; run down a passage and loot 1 chest. Good job you've cleared a cave. Some time you actually have to open the cave or treasure vault in some way, but as long as you have at least one active brain cell this is very doable. On extremely rare ocassions there is something you have to do in the cave to get your one chest, but as long as that one brain cell is still active you'll manage. On even rarer occassions you might encounter an enemy in a cave (OMG) which you'll destroy in a second, what a challenge. There are some other activities in the open world like you can pop 5 balloons in a row on your broom, this is so engaging and fun. There are even landing platforms you can land on and that's about it. The combat is dreadfully easy, you are playing with cheats as your aimbot is turned on probably as it was developed for consoles. You can aim normally, but then the game zooms in so the back of your head covers half the screen. The lock-on targeting system for PC is garbage as the way you switch targets is with the arrow keys, so never lock-on to an enemy, you have aimbot anyway. The enemy never dodges any of your spells either so feel free to massacre them. The enemy AI is really bad as well which makes an easy game even easier, the best example are the dugbogs which routinely gets stuck which means you can spam them down without them even moving. However the game should get some praise now and this is related to some mechanics of different enemy types like how you can use flipendo on the club of a troll after it has swung at you to flip it into its face, these kinds of things kept the combat from being completely boring. The secrets and puzzles of this game were not challenging at all for the most part. For example one of the hogwarts secrets are light 4 braziers on a bridge and then match the symbols. Whoever was in charge of designing the puzzles must have been designing this for toddlers. However I will give praise to one single thing related to puzzles and that is the depulso puzzle rooms as they were the only fun puzzles to do in this game albeit a bit short. The by far best part of this game is the room of requirement which will appeal to people that like making houses in the sims. The room of requirement also have up to 4 vivariums unlocked through story progression which can hold the beasts you capture. The game should also get a bonus for having very good shiny rates for the beasts as I don't think many would have wanted Pokemon levels of shiny rates for the beasts in this game.There's no quidditch in this game which is understandable, but instead it was replaced with broom races. You are challenge by some arrogant asshole named Imelda to beat her times. To describe how easy she is to beat, you can start the race, then go make dinner, eat your dinner, take a shit and then come back to still be faster than her. She is supposed to be the fastest racer at Hogwarts, but after leaving her in the dust you can check the leaderboards for the race and she's nowhere to be found. The leaderboard times are not very difficult to beat either which is disappointing. I was hoping there was more broom races, but there are only 3.-Spoilers ahead-As is very common now the story is set in stone, none of your choices have any impact whatsoever. Towards the end of the story two of the main antagonists have a falling out and one of these confronts you and offer you to work together with him to take down the main antagonists. Personally I would have liked to be able to accept this offer, but instead MC is dumb and wants to kill him instead. There are technically two endings, but they are extremely similar and the ending is decided by drum roll... dialogue options before final boss fight. Nothing really matters and that is extremely evident throughout the game. The characters are also really shallow, but then again we don't really interact much with any of the characters.If you want to play a game set in the Harry Potter universe I'd rather recommend the older Harry Potter games as they are far more engaging and challenging."
156,33,it is a very good game
157,14,"I thought being single player would push me away, but I ended up loving this game. The graphics are amazing, the storyline is so interesting. The game pulls you in and excites the player. 10/10 recommend."
158,8,"To be clear, I'm not leaving a negative review because of the recent controversy. I couldn't give a damn about JK Rowling's opinions or how others have chosen to interpret them.In truth, I want to recommend this game. I want to recommend it so much, just for its merits in gameplay and design, but I can't. I can't because the game is sadly suffering from poor optimisations and serious stuttering. I know its not cutting-edge hardware, but an RTX 3080 should be able to handle it on high settings at the very least, yet I have to tone the settings to mostly medium just to get a playable framerate.What really drives the point home is that this game actually runs better on the steam deck. Some are blaming Denuvo DRM for the poor performance, but until the game runs smoothly (whether it be because Denuvo is patched out of the game or the game is optimised to run smoothly even with Denuvo attached), this is where my review will end."
159,19,A dream come true
160,27,"If you're unsure about wether you should get it or not, do it. You won't regret it, unless you're a miserable muggle."

162,21,Very good game been playing it since its release had a great beginning but since the updates having problems  with the graphics for the game with the NPC and my player faces and stuff
163,32,Amazing game.
164,5,Very interesting
165,5,"World is gorgeous, spells have so far been interesting. Not terribly far in yet but there seems to be a good number of enjoyable puzzles to solve. Ravenclaw, Rowan Pheonix Feather Wand, running around known places from the universe. It's a dream come true."
166,6,while still a bit glitchy this is a well put together game that is truly open world. You can go anywhere you want to you just might not survive the encounters.

182,6,Really good game
183,20,"Its a good game that unfortunately is relying too much on ""we member"" if you know what i mean.needs more side quests and npc interactions plus the main character needs to shut the f up with his repetitive comments, then it would probably be a great game"
184,14,"Do NOT buy unless you at least meet the RECOMMENDED requirements! Unfortunately the specs given for this game are pretty misleading. I have a GTX 1050 ti, and I meet all the other requirements for the game. This meets the minimum requirements but not the recommended. I have had nothing but trouble getting this game to work. I have read that other people who have much better hardware than me also have this problem so I'm not sure if it's the game or my hardware. I can run the game on low, but even then there are fps stutters and texture popping. I was content to play like this until this morning, I booted up the game and now it's unplayable with major graphics issues, and audio stutter. At this point I have spent so much time getting this game to work, I'm ready to give up. Maybe I'll try again after some patches come out and my patience for the whole thing has reset."
185,8,Amazing all round
186,6,"This game is amazing! the visuals, story line, the MAGIC! JKR is my favorite person in the world for creating such an amazing world. I will support anything she stands for and I will support anything she comes out with next. The JKR haters are missing out :)"
187,13,"It's a damn good thing Elden Ring didn't release the same year as this game.This game is Game of The year, in whatever year it's released. Jfc. K that's all I have time to write, back to it."

191,29,"Game is a top notch RPG set in the Harry Potter universe. Do not let any of the reviews about JK rowland detour you. Hogwarts Legacy has the same ambiance as the first 4 HP movies, mostly fun sometimes darker than you would have expected, overall fun."

208,10,i like being a magic student
209,4,Im a wizard. I was not expecting the game to be this well put together. I never was a fan of the Harry Potter franchise but this is just a good game
210,10,Yes but not optimized very well (in terms of memory and lag) great gameplay tho
211,1,Can't even start this POS. Constant crashes...
212,15,This may be the next skyrim-tier open world. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this game was far better than any notions or nay-saying done before the release. One of my favorite games since Elden Ring. 10/10 very good outside of the token trans npc.
213,12,Is fun and has a Victorian vibe to it. my wife loves harry potter books and stuff
214,18,Game good but needs some performance optimizations.

248,14,It's like Skyrim but you actually commit to being a Mage rather than giving up and becoming an archer for the 43rd time.
249,24,im a big harry potter fan myself and this brings all the good memories back
250,11,Get it youll love it!
251,5,this game is really good ive only played for 8 hours and its great
252,10,GOAT OF A GAME 
253,1,"the pc performance is pretty horrible, even with rtx 3080ti, running the global graphical setting at ""High"" the framerate will drop to 30 to 40 fps here and there most of the time. it feels like a good game within my limited 3 hrs of gameplay, but it's impossible to overlook the extremely poor pc performance."
254,10,best game of 2023
255,3,This game has got me as excited as when witcher 3 came out. I am only 4 hours deep but felt like 40 min. Highly recommend playing this one.

257,16,good game
258,10,It's great.

260,27,Most unrealistic part is that Ravenclaw won the house cup in my play through.  8/10 otherwise
261,9,Entertaining adventure
262,12,good game. Be better if steam didn't force us to put a comment.
263,7,"Got an access to upgrades on lvl 18 (the quest is for lvl 4), instantly had 14 new perks10/10 hogwarts experience"
264,3,it's one of the best games i've ever played!
265,8,"In my opinion, this just doesn't share the same magic as the books or the movies, and it falls flat in comparison to other open-world RPG adventures I have enjoyed. I think the core issue is that the player protagonist doesn't have much personality, and that limited what they could do with the storytelling and immersion. This game was safely designed and well marketed, but has since fallen off the radar in a market well supplied with punchy and innovative offerings launching every week."
266,10,"Absolutely best game out their right now would highly recommend getting the game without a question. Everything about this game has been done really well for example the main story plot, side quests, characters and the game mechanics worth every penny 👍"
267,39,It's every Harry Potter's fan dream come true
268,14,"My saves were deleted after like 20 hours. Then I fixed it. It is a really good game but the stuttering is out of this world, with no patch in sight. A patch to fix the stuttering would be most appreciated."

297,36,"this game has everything a harry potter fan would mostly want. it is full of magic,story lines,combat and you get so immersed into the game. that you just keep on playing. it has been a long time for me sinds i found a game's story so good i loved it."
298,20,"Need more beast, hope that they will add dlc for the new beast"

313,13,this game is super fun
314,18,great game if you love exploring and love fanisty
315,19,It was hyped up a lot and actually feel like it was pretty accurate.
316,40,"Very fun game, open world, can play as a dark wizard or a nice one.A bit of glitches but it's recently released so there will be patches.Worth every single dollar."
317,1,"I couldn't even judge the game itself. For those that can play it, it probably is good. But for us that crash like harrys broom into the whoomping willow... well"
318,41,Strong 7 /10
319,10,"This game is basically my childhood dream come true. I never got my letter at 11, but now, as I am 22 it finally happened <3"

321,17,RAWENCLAW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
322,25,Game good.
323,18,"Overall It's an alright game.It's objectively not a great RPG tho.I'd recommend it for harry potter fans but if you expect a fully fledged RPG, try something else.This will be a no recommendation until they fix the performance issues tho."
324,8,"extremely satisfying to play and view. I7 12700 rtx 3060. no stuttering. laptop gets HOT 85-90 degrees on cpu, high 80's gpu. Nice to play a game you don't have to play for weeks to advance 5 minutes in the story line."
325,4,"good game, good story, fun, Sebastian is the best"
326,17,"After 30 hours of play time, I feel ready for this review. At first, this game is amazing. The world Avalanche built is incredible, Hogwarts is just perfect. As a Harry Potter fan, I read all the books when I was a kid and being able to explore Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest and everything else is awesome. That said... Let's talk about real gameplay.This game does not trully rewards exploration. AT ALL. Let's be honest... going through dungeons or puzzles to get to the end and be like ""oh cool, my scarf now can be blue."" or ""ANOTHER DAMN UGLY GLASSES THAT I WON'T USE. THANKS"" is frustrating. So after a while I just gave up on exploring because it feel like wasted time.Do you really expect me to go all the trouble of that many collectibles to get a robe color? Or a broom appearance? Nope.The AI is DUMB. Despite the combat looking much better than I expected, after a few hours it feels a LOT repetitive. It is not really challengin: just find a combo you like, keep pressing R2 and looking at your char to know when to press dodge or block. I mean... every fight feels exactly the same. It is boring. There are no different strategies that really matter.Honestly... at this point, I'm just going to burn through the story and hope to see the end of this."
327,16,"10/10, my PC was ready for takeoff every time I played this game, but it was well worth it."
328,29,"Avoid, still plenty of bugs and now my game is stuck on loading screen..."
329,31,game is dope
330,10,"Haven't even explored half of this game and it's so fun. The things you can do are insane! So much exploration, fun side quests, and so far a really good story! 10/10!"
331,21,one of the better games i have seen in a wile for sure

333,16,ZULULULLLL
334,2,"Not a huge harry potter fan, but the game and world building is great. Highly recommend for anyone that enjoys single player open world RPGs with a good story."
335,34,Fun combat and pretty good story seriously marred by tons of Ubisoft formula tedium. They should've just filled up the world with more proper content instead of tens of Merlin chores and invisibile collectables. 82/100.
336,17,You can pet the cats
337,2,Amazingly FUN.
338,8,This is the Harry Potter game I've been waiting for!
339,10,I enjoy it very well would recommend
340,15,"Amazing game play, graphics, immersion, so many collectibles and side quests and spells to choose from. This game truly is addicting and worth the price for the amount of hours you'll get out of it! This is the Hogwarts game I've always wanted."
341,43,Endless enjoyment
342,2,Story line is really good. Lots of side quests to do to keep you busy.
343,2,super fun
344,6,Listen... Ravenclaw is not THAT bad...
345,7,incredible
346,2,Incendio 🔥🔥
347,39,"I love this game. I played Elder Scrolls for almost 20 y staring with Oblivion. I can see this game with the same potential. I hope they keep making more Hogwarts. Pleas, Pleas."
348,12,Wonder full graphics! Great world map! and also the first piece of Harry Potter media to include a trans character!
349,22,"I haven't enjoyed a game this much in a long time and this one is that good, it has the potential to be game of the year."
350,21,"Love the game, and it works on my potato computer which is a plus."
351,6,"All I'm going to say is this game is VALID, PERIOD.."

364,33,Absolutely top tier
365,23,Awesomely fun game.
366,59,Performance is decent and game play is amazing. They made the combat system feel smooth and strategic.
367,7,"Amazingly detailed and magical, JKR can eat a mound of dirt and catch some avada kedavra.Definitely worth the buy"
368,26,I really like Harry Potter. Most fun I've had with a game in awhile.
369,7,"Ancient magic of EVADE ROLL and 'PRESS x TO KILL'Immersive experience of SOCIETY WE LIVE IN TODAY (twitter edition)Cutting edge technology of MEDIUM-LOW AND SLOW on 3060Ti (artifacts included)Revealing history of Hogwarts THAT DOES NOT MATCH ITS PRESENTGroundbreaking gameplay of SPINNING WORLD GLOBES, PETTING THE CATS and PILFERING PRIVATE PROPERTY in plain sightIngenious wand combat system right from PIANO CLASSES, and WOW COOLDOWN MANAGEMENTA single player experience WITH 'A MOUNT AND A HAT' DLC FOR 20 EUROS ON TOPI could go on like this for a long time... But I actually do not see any reason to spend that much time. My review is one  in tens of thousands, no one will evem ever read this.I could say that most of the the game is well made. But the fact is that the most of the actual GAME game is NOT well made. What's really well made, is 3D decorations of Hogwarts itsef, surrounding areas and other visual stuff. But the most of the actual game mechanics feel clunky and look like a list of missed oportunities, and NOT immersive at all. And still, I see a lot of 'Positive' reviews that only run through the things they 'don't like' and still say 'yes I recommend'. Like, people. Come on. Be honest!And the most important lesson here would be: Harry Potter and Dark Souls just do not mix well."
370,27,great game any potter head would love
371,7,Great games full of magic and nostalgia. Hours and hours of exciting game play and adventure. Exactly what was needed!
372,1,"Merlin’s beard, Potter!"
373,25,Amazing Game! Definitely worth all the hype!
374,3,Great combat mechanics and super fun. Side quests are not tedious and often give players experience and awards them with items useful to improve character abilities.

377,11,"What the hell you did to that game?First few days very nice graphics, smooth running, revelio here revelio there....And then after some update everything looks like when you wake up after 5 days weekend in different city still on drugs.Polishing details are missing, textures are fked up, everything looks like the graphics did not render completely.Utter rubbish.And it was working very good before.What have you done..."
378,9,"great combat, good skill upgrades although no skillpoint refunds. Lots of lore but interesting even to a non-fan"
379,5,You're a Wizard Harry
380,2,Too many tech issues.  Save your money until the game has been finished.
381,22,You get to be a wizard AND piss off the blue hairs
382,6,"Just so slow and boring. Hardest difficulty doesn't pose a challenge. I force myself to play it in hopes of SOMETHING to get me happy about it.Oh yeah don't forget the fucking platforms, shit repetetive level design. And when the combat is actually satisfying, give a total of 10 minutes of it. Useless boring game that looks good."
383,13,Fun to play
384,31,this is act of love from me
385,3,Engaging story and the fighting mechanics are a lot more fun than I would have expected
386,26,Pretty ok game.  One of the issues at this point is that it needs a lot of optimizing.  I run a beefy machine and still have a latency and frame issue.
387,6,Great game but it keeps crashing.I've tried to grin and bear it but with my drivers updated and hardware that's definitely up to the task...it's not good enough when i've paid almost sixty quid on a game
388,6,"Less Game play , more Of cutsense, maybe rather than making a game, you guys should have made a netflix series."
389,11,Very fun
390,56,"Unfortunately, it can't be played in Multiplayer and doesn't have the Re-Talent skill system.... if the makers can. ....This game has a chance to win this year's Game of the Year award."

398,18,"No idea how 30hs passed in this game. And after all this time, is till unlocking new features, spells and story to me. Is incredible, one of the best games out there, ever. I am looking forward to fully explore it, is alot of fun."
399,9,"Combat is a lot of fun, love the flying, and Hogwarts looks outstanding"
400,37,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
401,20,AAA animal crossing 10/10
402,9,A lot of effort went into making this game look great but not much went into the actual gameplay itself.  I was hooked for the first 10 hours or so and then it became a shallow slog.  This is not a bad game just disappointing and mediocre.  For generic combat/looting/idle mechanics with a Hogwarts skin look no further.  If you want to actually roleplay a hogwarts student rather being forced into the role of a psychopathic murderous spell caster then this is not the game.I wish Steam allowed partial refunds for pricey games like this that put in just enough effort to get you well past the 2 hour window before revealing their shallowness.
403,55,"As someone who enjoys the Harry Potter movies but isn't necessarily a die-hard fan, I was excited to try out ""Hogwarts Legacy"" after hearing rave reviews from my friend who is a Potterhead. I went all-in and purchased the deluxe edition, eager to explore the stunning and immersive world that awaited me.And I wasn't disappointed - the game truly is a visual marvel, with so much to discover and do. Whether you enjoy puzzles, collecting fantastic beasts (which are essentially the game's version of Pokémon), or unraveling mysteries, there's always something new to keep you engaged.After completing the main mission, though, I found myself feeling somewhat unsatisfied. The characters' side stories felt confusing, and I'm not sure whether it was because of the choices I made or something else, but the outcome didn't seem to make sense within the larger narrative. It was as if the game had already predetermined an ending that didn't quite fit.In addition, there were some performance issues with raytracing, even though I have an RTX 3080 that should be able to handle any raytracing game with ease at 1440p. I was able to find mods that helped to alleviate this problem, but it was still disappointing to encounter these issues in the first place.As such, while ""Hogwarts Legacy"" certainly has its moments, I don't feel comfortable recommending it at this time. And especially considering the standard edition's hefty price tag of €60, it's hard to justify spending that much money on a game that comes with performance issues that players may need to fix on their own."
404,27,"I really wanted to love this game, and it's not bad at all, but there is too much bad gamedesign to make it a great game. If you want an atmospheric game its a 10/10 (if you somehow manage to run it at max settings) Its the gameplay where it falls short! Tedious grinding in a singleplayer game, to enable you to to more tedious and boring gameplay, is just bad gamedesign! The game seems littered with content, but once you scratch the surfuce you will find out just how much of the same bs is duplicated and thrown out all over the place..Ex. trials of merlin could have been a more fleshed out side-quest with 5-10 interesting puzzles in series, and would unlock some appearances or something in the line of that. instead you have to do boring grinding, just to not be pestered with a full inventory of gear every 5 min, its just bad gamedesign! !spoiler! And if that isnt enough, the game wont let you finish the game without you giving in to all the grind! V E R Y bad gamedesign! The bad game design makes the game land on a overall (4/10) score, its that bad gamedesign! very sad!"
405,17,"nice game!!!!!really recommend this game to all the potter' fans!!!!!for those who are not there fans, try it! and you will fall in love with harry potter! Nice story!!!!Nice Game!!!!"
406,14,Gets interesting everyday
407,20,"Exceeded my expectations by a mile, flying and combat is very satisfying and fun :)) +we can use unforgivable curses, so that makes it ten times funner in my book"
408,2,very good game
409,23,"Good shit. Dumstrang next, please"
410,17,"Much Swish, such flick, very leviosa"
411,25,"Excellent game, a bit of performance issue but that's understandable on early access."
412,26,worth every cent.
413,46,"So I've been on the fence with this game since release. I have played a fair amount, but at the moment this seems to be driven almost by compulsion than enjoyment. The world is beautiful, yet there isn't a lot in it. The phrase 'wide as an ocean, shallow as puddle' applies perfectly here which shows what a trap an open world can be for a video game. What there is to do in the world consists mostly of go to a location marked on the map, go down a short corridor or tunnel, find a chest, and you're done. Sometimes there's a very simple puzzle before the chest can be reached or perhaps instead of a chest it is some other macguffin. More infuriating is the rewards from these chests are either tiny amounts of currency or randomised gear which quickly becomes useless except to sell for small amounts of currency you don't need because everything was purchased long ago.The story itself is confused and nonsensical. Who is our character? Why did they start late? Do they have family? No idea! Could be an orphan or a particularly angsty teenager. Maybe they're muggleborn. For such a seemingly important person who even the Ministry has taken an interest in, no one seems to care where you came from. So much just happens in this story for no reason, and even the characters sometimes take a double-take. At one point your character even says 'At this point, I've just learned to go along with it.' when explaining the story thus far to another character. Writers: if you feel your character in universe would say this, your writing is bad. I haven't completed the game and am uncertain if I will, but I doubt some sudden revelation will fix the story.This also isn't a game about being a Hogwarts student. If anything, the game is embarrassed that it is set in a school in the first place. You participate in 3.5 classes, though these consist of doing one activity and then a cutscene. After that, every other class is simply a cutscene. Instead you'll do assignments which often don't have anything to do with the spell you'll learn, and then your Divination teacher will teach you a defensive spell for some reason. Hilariously, the best integration of assignments with spell learning is when the Hogwarts caretaker who is supposed to be in charge of student discipline teaches you how to break and enter and then proceeds to tell you to do it all over the game world. The game actively encourages criminality as well since finding items for your little hub are usually hidden in other people's homes behind locks. You'll spend far more time in Argyllshire looting said homes than you will in school, though evidently the classes are taking place off screen since teachers will endlessly comment on how well you are doing. Am I doing well? Weird, I haven't been inside these walls since September, but look at these fancy, contemporary clothes I just dug out of a 500-year-old-tomb. Was super easy as the door was open, and all I had to do was walk down a corridor, take a left, and there was the chest. Fashion sure hasn't changed much in 500 years, eh?As I said, it is a beautiful world, and Hogwarts is realised in painstaking detail. It's just a shame that optimisation seems to have been ignored. Even on a fairly beefy rig, the framerate can suddenly crawl. This is annoying normally, but in fights it becomes infuriating as your inputs won't be recognised in time to block or dodge attacks. Some enemies cause this all the time such as trolls. It's also a frequent occurrence to simply fall through the game map, but thankfully you can hop on your broom and fly back up through the ground.I'd say in short this game needed months back in oven, and I really wish they had actually tried to capture the setting of the books, that is: a student going to a magical school. Even a curfew could have been fun done well, and why were house points taken away? It's not bad as a scenic journey through the countryside, a walking tour of Hogwarts, or possibly if you are itching to murder many hundreds of faceless witches and wizards as a 15-year-old. As an RPG though it fails pretty miserably and plays a lot like an MMO, just in single player."
414,13,its alright
415,19,Must-have if you're a Potterhead
416,20,nice game
417,27,"Love the game, amazing open world to explore for harry potter fans, story is a little lacking but still very enjoyable with tons to do."
418,8,too good
419,12,I have been transported to the wizarding world that I forgot that I have a job.
420,29,fun game!
421,4,"It's a very fun free roam game, full of magic, great stories and secrets. If you're a fan of the books/films or not, this game is suited for everyone who likes a good adventure."
422,2,i just played it for a few hours and im still at the beginning but its already safe to say that this game worth every penny i spent
423,8,It is a good game but it was quite hard for me to understand how to play against hard bosses
424,9,pet the cat! wow
425,24,Super fun and immersive.  I'm greatly enjoying this!
426,10,This game has re-ignited my passion for single-player adventure games.
427,16,Just One Reason: The magic fighting is very entertaining!
428,45,"It's marketed as an open-world RPG but it's really not. Exploration is highly repetitive and the combat/gear/progression systems are not well-designed. There's also not much room for personalisation, no morality system and none of the dialogue choices actually matter, so as a result you can't really relate much with the main character throughout. In a nutshell, it delivers the basics of what is expected of a game set in the HP universe, but there's a lot of wasted potential as an open world RPG. If there's going to be a sequel to this, I hope it can be developed by a studio who's more experienced in designing RPGs."
429,6,"Apart from the caracter gets a robotic voice if you lower or higher the voice pitch, the game is great"
430,44,"Путешествие в детство. Огромная благодарность художникам, дизайнерам и композитору игры за окружение. Моё почтение, всё на высшем уровне."
431,4,"liked everything, disliked nothing.  (hope that helps)"
432,49,Really good if you can run it smoothly..
433,2,Its the harry potter game that if waited all my life
434,2,So far very fun and you can easily play for hours.
435,27,Felix Felicis ? PS5 extra-quest ? DLC where ?
436,34,Story is quite engaging and the combat is pretty fun. Wish there was more options of spells though.
437,34,"It's a really good game, the combat is fun, story is entretaining and the open world feels like it's alive. 100% worth it."
438,5,GOOD BUT PLS PERFORMANCE FIXES
439,38,"Linear and not really replayable, a bit clumsy controls, but you can get used to. No choices, you will be forced to act as scripted.Still beatiful, fun and moreover - filled with references, humor and easter eggs. Definitely worth it's price."
440,4,"top notch game, nice graphics, plenty of things to do and explore. High attention to detail. Such a great game highly recommend it"
441,11,It's not a bug; it's called magic.
442,21,It would be nice to have a PVP
443,0,"0/10I spent 6 hours troubleshooting this game and I've not once been able to play it despite my ""32 minutes of Playtime"". I've tried every work around and I can't even play. I've played free games that had less issues, Star Citizen and Cyberpunk 2077 ran 100x better and I could actually play. Warner Bros. should pay people to play because this was not worth the $60 spent on this. What a waste of time."
444,38,best game of 2023 for me so far.
445,6,avada kadavra
446,11,Insanely good.
447,26,Absolutely marvellous game. What a nostalgic return to Hogwarts this was...
448,7,G.O.T.Y.
449,31,a Harry Potter fan dreams come true. Flawless game
450,19,Even if you dont like harry potter this game is good
451,1,i can finally be a wizzy from midevil times
452,0,Got the early access and the game just wont run. 
453,7,Absolutely mint
454,40,Sir- ona :D
455,93,Easy 10/10 game. its hogwarts what more do you want. pc issue aside it plays amazing. it looks like all roads point to hogsmeade.
456,10,Give us multiplayer
457,3,I like garlic
458,27,The game is fun Had a few graphical bugs but nothing that didn't get fixed by reloading the game It needs more enemies and bosses
459,10,huggkjlhiukjjuhojklhi
460,4,perfect.expecto patronammmmmmmmmm
461,17,Best Wizarding World game to date!
462,11,very fun
463,21,"such a fun ""magical"" experience"
464,39,It isn't a perfect game.  But it's still really fun and better than I thought it was going to be.  Can't wait for more content.
465,39,"Apart from the fact the game won't work well unless you have the yet to release 50 series GPUs, and the voice actors came from Fiverr. It's a brilliant game!"
466,15,This game is very good. Highly recommend it
467,11,"beautiful game, very satisfying fighting"
468,35,Well done and plays great
469,12,Great Story fun gamplay
470,1,I'm a Hufflepuff
471,20,Anything from the trolley?
472,4,as someone who has never watched the harry potter films read the books or played the previous games... so far ive really enjoyed it tbh.
473,30,Probably one of the best games I have ever played.
474,20,"Outdated graphics but fun gameplay.Repetitive quests but fun combat.Confusing controls but satisfying outcomes.8/10. Considering the lack of good game releases recently, this is a godsend."
475,24,"The game is beautiful, and it is the game of the year for 2023. Also, the game is distinguished by the simple open world, and also the player’s movements are very wonderful"
476,13,"I do not recommend this game , after playing 20 hours i started speaking to snakes"
477,10,god I love Forspoken its a great ga... wait a second
478,14,the game
479,2,"Amazing game! I typically don't get into games like this, but this one has captivated me. So well done!"
480,17,I like to cast spells and pretend that I am a wizard and do cool magic wizard flips
481,33,"I thought that there would be something like Bulli, in the end it turned out something sickly sweet and toothless, with unrealistically ideal characters...+Great graphics+ Magical atmosphere in the game world...+fluffy, cats and other furry animalsAnd that's where all the positives of the game ended =(-Poor editor when creating a character-badly written characters-poorly written main character-Short and sometimes boring story quest-lack of romanceДумала, что будет что то вроде Bulli, в итоге получилось что то нечто приторно сладкое и пушистое..."
482,12,There are no cons
483,24,"As a Flipendo user, I agree with the game8/10 overallwould buy it again"
484,7,"Its alittle buggy, would appreciate it if the developers fix that."
485,16,"I can't believe they made you play as a Br*tish person, absolutely disgusting."
486,20,I feel sad that the game is over but happy at the same time that it exists 100/100
487,24,"A game of missed opportunities. Aside that it runs poorly, there are some REALLY disappointing game mechanics:1. There is nothing to do in Hogwarts and the game constantly gives you quests to go explore the outside world.2. The room of requirement: I would gladly go to the potion classroom and the greenhouse to brew potions and plant plants. Same goes for the pets. Room of Requirement should have been a place to practice your spells or just a room that you can decorate/upgrade your equipment/etc.3. You can't sell potions or plants. Why is finding ugly equipment the only way of making gold in game?4. Most common thing you get as a reward is (mostly) ugly looking piece of equipment to no end.5. You buy ALL potions recipes from Hogsmeade. What is potion professor for? - to teach you spells LOL6. Why can't I buy things at Zonko's AND USE THEM IN COMBAT or to troll my classmates/professors? 7. Why can't I buy things at Honeydukes and use them to replenish my HP? Or even gift them as presents to to other ppl or just buy them to waste my gold.8. Really? No Quidditch and it is because the headmaster sucks? Really?9. Enemies: Humans, trolls, spiders and inferi. Good job.10. What is the point of locked doors if there are 10 more locked doors after it. SO ANNOYING. Can you please make the Alohomora 3 an instant unlock?11. I think I could have designed better staircase. 12. Ghosts and portraits are almost non interactable with.13. There is no points collection rewards. I think it would be fun if instead of having a non meaningful scene of you attending the class, YOU actually attending the class, prof asking questions and if you answer them correctly, you get points. This knowledge could be obtained from chests, ghosts and other things for example instead of just rewarding ugly meaningless equipment.14. I wish I could have an ACTUAL relationship meters where I can do quests for professors, different houses and local folk. Would be amazing if as I advance the relationships I get lore, I am able to visit other house rooms and get different quests if I decide to advance them (instead of everything being offered).15. HUD sucks. I don't need a million markers on my map nor (ugly yellow pixelated) quest indicators. I JUST NEED A COMPASS. Maybe instead of marking everything on the map, after advancing a certain quest, through conversation with NPC you would get locations of near places of interest. I am sure that there will be more disappointing things as I advance in the game, but so far I am finding more things that I am disappointed about than amazed with.Hogwarts is beautifully designed and there are some really neat easter eggs and somewhat challenging puzzles that aren't obvious and need a min or two to think about. But the rest is just repetitive and not challenging at all. I see no reason why they would waste time on making a large map with random villages instead of making Hogwarts a main place of exploration."
488,27,This game is awsome! coop or mp asap =)
489,5,So much fun. Reminds me of Fable in a way but Harry Potter which is my ultimate dream game! Super excited to keep playing
490,0,Game doesnt even load past shaders gets stuck my total trime played has been spent on a screen warning me of seizures or trying to load shaders on a bar that doesnt move
491,20,"This game has amazing visuals and the combat system is pretty good too. But this game is sold as a RPG and it has no RPG elements. You don't have choices in this game and you can't be a particular wizard either. Instead you're a wonderboy perfect, can do everything wizard that is always cheery and respectful.Oh, and how did they make learning new spells fun? Every time you're ready to learn a new spell you have to complete the most boring assignments to learn it. Either it is doing some combat feats or drinking multiple potions at the same time, throwing out some plants at the same time. It's so freaking tedious!And also what's up with the menu design? Navigate with a freaking pointer while its much faster to just press up or down. No sell all button while you have sell a LOT of gear.Yeah, they shower you with meaningless gear in this game, probably 99% of my play time was spent just changing gear for a green that is better then a legendary 4 drops later.There's more but fuck listing everything. Also to be fair, good music and voice acting, although the voice acting doesn't really have to push itself when it comes to emotion."
492,39,"From 120 fps to 10-20? Ok, np"
493,26,"I have to say I am very happy with the game, I love the diversity and the amazing graphics. I am a huge fan. This is a wonderful game. I love it."
494,25,Best game ever. I have been enjoying it. Hogwarts Legacy is everything I have wanted. Thank you the best game.
495,22,best game
496,23,Good game
497,6,gooooooood
498,18,Hogwarts. RPG. Amazing.
499,4,please add multiplayer and quidditch.too many nerd up in here. give me more draco malfoyamazing game with good story
500,33,Avada Kadabra!
501,5,You can pet cats. 10/10
502,23,Wonderfully fun.
503,8,A little boring...in battle.
504,1,"they need to fix the lagg.I chrck every settings in the game still.have it.Using helios 500 nvidia 1070 8gb,32 Gb Ram  and +2Tb ssd 970 evo plus. If you can help me i can play  the game joy."
505,25,"Excellent gameplay, wonderful and immersive world of wizarding. What else do you need?"
506,3,6 hours in and i haven't even done my first story quest yet. good stuff.
507,8,"Glorified Ubisoft game with harry potter reskin. Doesn't help that the game has been trying to go politically correct that totally breaks immersion. Your character is basically a ""Yes sir"" or a ""Slightly moody teenager."" Economy seems totally busted, with at it's core either a ""poacher sim"" or a ""sell my 1000th useless loot."" RPG elements in the game don't really go far, with using ""unforgivable curses"" having NO repercussions whatsoever to your character in game story wise. Suffers alot from Cyberpunk 2077's ""beautiful set piece but a boring game."" The stuttering and frame drops also definitely DO NOT help this game at all (for reference im playing with a 3070 and still getting huge stuttering in 1080p or 1440p)...Main story introduces you to an antagonist, that seems ""strong"" and is trying to get to a power that the player is also trying to reach. But it doesn't really explain the stakes at hand at all? Vague asf and ultimately not that interesting. Can't believe i stopped playing elden ring for this."
508,18,I don't have any words to describe this game. 10/10
509,8,The devs didn't give me enough time to upgrade my PC
510,25,"Alot of small bugs, but it doesnt ruin the game."
511,8,"This is the shittiest PC port I have ever played. The stuttering I experience even after the patch renders the game completely unplayable. Character faces and expressions are lifeless, and the whole world is soulless. The attempt at making an inclusive character creator is lackluster at best, and insulting at worst. There are still clearly two stereotypical gender expressions. Sure you can mix and match feminine/masculine voices with a masculine/feminine body and title (witch/wizard), but there are still only two of each, clearly meant to correspond with the cis normative gender dichotomy. The token trans character is a joke, and feels like a derogatory pity party. Seriously, don't buy this game, it's unplayable and clearly not ready for release. I would have gotten a refund, but I spent over two hours trying to fix this pile of human waste, so I might finish the game if it gets fixed. Still not worth buying this lifeless mess. If you want to buy this game regardless of your money going to the genocide of trans people, get some help."
512,31,Worth every cent. So much nostalgia. Love it
513,9,"Cool game I must say, not a big fan of harry potter thing, but its fun. Huge world, nice quests, good story, combat 8/10. I recommend it, but wait for -20% offer."
514,6,"Now that it's finally working for me after the last update, I'm having the time of my life just magic-ing about Hogwarts!"
515,6,its honestly one of my favorite games now
516,42,"Very fun game, a bit glitchy and laggy rn but still enjoyable9/10"
517,9,"I'm really, really enjoying this game! I don't care for all the background controversy. Just enjoy life for what it is, and enjoy this game :D"
518,1,неоптимизированное говнище
519,2,As long as there is DENUVO my review will be NEGATIVE.***Enquanto houver DENUVO meu review vai ser NEGATIVO.

529,4,Game is god damn amazing! Everything about it is amazing! 10/10
530,50,"Game of the Year material - definitely the best game ever created from the Wizarding World universe.And even if you don't like Harry Potter at all, you will still receive an amazing fantasy RPG experience.10/10"
531,0,they make you play as a british person (also this game crashes alot)
532,20,"One of the most better story adventure games I played lately, slightly reminds of bully as a school vibe"
533,24,shadow wizard money gang. WE LOVE CASTING SPELLZ!
534,24,Open world is REAL the battle system is intricate enough to have souls like components (which game doesn't huh?) but to stay unique as well.
535,33,"amazing, better than i expected"
536,4,"Game is so good, everyone should play it"
537,11,nudy w chuj xd
538,14,GOOD GAME

541,22,Hands down game of the year
542,36,Omg so much fun! and im not really that into the harry potter stuff but this game is great!
543,65,guess I'm transphobia now sorry everyone.
544,9,"My recommendation: Just watch a ''Hogwarts Legacy All Cutscenes/Full Movie' video. Not worth playing.Quite a forgettable experience.Bought it on the HP hype, should have watched a few hours of a let's play video, to realize this just isn't a 2023 RPG."
545,9,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
546,13,i love it
547,23,lost all game progression after 39 hours
548,6,Excellent game for the Harry Potter franchise. Definitely recommend.
549,2,it is a good game great storyline beautiful graphics but please fix stuttering and FPS drop
550,47,Love Everything about this game and little to no bugs on release!
551,29,"A lot of fun to be had here, But the combat is very easy even on hard mode but just being in the Harry Potter world is enough if you are really into the Wizard world this is a dream for you. I give it 7/10 its not the best game ever made but it is up there."
552,5,"A really good game. I like it.  It has all - the story, the action and more."
553,12,Great game! Feel right at home eat Hogwarts
554,12,game mechanics
555,3,"This game breaks immersion everytime I get immersed into it, the game runs like shit the characters are unlikable and I blieve that this game is overhyped."
556,19,The boi who lived come to die........AVADA KEDAVRA!!!!!
557,6,"Kino train, get on board"
558,12,avada kedavraring bitches is fun
559,12,"I have spent 20 hours on this game and it has reset my progress twice im so fucking done. The first time i thought it might've just been because i forgot to save or smth and i wasnt that far in so i decided to just restart. The second time, i remember saving and when i try to load a game, there's nothing there. I can't even get a refund because ive played 20 hours and now have no motivation to play it all again."
560,11,"Beautiful Game, fun Combat mechanics and a interesting story.Must have for any Harry Potter Fan and a strong recommendation for any Action RPG Fan."
561,39,Great game
562,12,it seems all roads lead to frame drops
563,2,Incredible game. One of the best I have ever played. Worth every dollar.
564,14,"Great Game, would recommend"
565,33,"How to play Hogwarts Legacy:1. Stop looking at negative reviews. 2. Completely ignore the pointless agenda-driven controversy from both sides, you are not hurting anyone, you are not endorsing anything.3. Steal 40$ from your mom.4. Purchase and play the game.5. Enjoy."
566,3,hogsnorts tha 1
567,10,its a great game greqat flying mechanics fps drops alot tho still fairly new the story has a typical youre the chosen one but half way thru its nice

569,2,Fantastic graphics. Fantastic stories. Fantastic gameplay.Fantastic game.And I am NOT a Harry Potter Fan.
570,12,"It's a good game. Unfortunately, that's enough for purchase in 2023. It's not a brilliant one, like the Witcher 3, but you can expect many hours of pure happiness. I would recommend it."
571,19,we love casting spells
572,8,"Great game, combat is great fun and story is very well made!"
573,8,its to good
574,5,Amazing Game love it so much
575,1,Horrible on AMD Software. constant crashes and no way around it.Im sure its a great game but practically unplayable for the percentage of the population that plays on AMD.My Specs are: AMD Ryzen 3 3100 4 Core Processor 16GB RAM AMD 6600 XT GPUWaste of $70 Thank you Avalanche
576,6,Murk dem wizards
577,3,Great Game for all Harry Potter Fans!

579,2,one of the best games you'll play
580,30,having a blast becoming THE wizard
581,4,loved the game play. hate that spiders are a main part of the game. I hate them and have an intense fear of them. should be a way to change the appearance of spiders so they aren't as spidery looking.
582,15,There are too many game-breaking bugs to recommend buying this game at this time. There are currently a number of bugs which prevent progressing the main quest line.
583,5,You're a wizard Har.. *insert player name*
584,4,it is fun
585,40,"When poachers trap helpless beasts, it's poaching. And that's bad.When you trap helpless beasts, its ""rescuing"". And that's good.10/10 game. ...SHUT UP DEEK!"
586,86,Unforgivable curses are a horrible and terrible thing...that's why you try to use it on the first living thing you see after acquiring them.
587,15,Best game ever
588,7,Very exciting game! Extra bonus for pissing of extreme leftists!
589,16,"The game constantly crashes my PC, makes the PC restart, this only happens when playing on this game.Have changed dll files for dlss changed resolution, switched off raytracing and configured my 3090 GPU. Updated windows, drivers but still crashy. Other than that pretty fun game, shame it's giving me a bad time."
590,18,"Please use ""Revelio"" to reveal my review."
591,17,"With this kind of optimization, Avalanche should rename the PC Version to:Payable Today, Playable After 6 Months Edition!"
592,7,good game
593,8,Really enjoying the vibe.  There has been alot of thought and love put into this game.  Highly recommend.
594,9,its good
595,7,worth the money so thrilling
596,18,"The game is good fun, but the difficulty is not very high for the puzzles. You might want to turn off some things related to the HUD since all the info is just handed to you."
597,8,Pretty kewl
598,13,it has got to be one of the best games i have ever played
599,8,"So far this game is awesome, I'm lvl 17 and having a blast, thanks."
600,5,Thumbs Up!!
601,36,nice game :)
602,14,Professor Garlick (✿◕‿◕✿)
603,5,The Harry Potter game we've all been wanting years for.
604,39,"Stunning visuals, great music and very detailed environment for HP fans. Combat and gameplay is not that bad either. But story, dialogues and writing in general is horrible. Both very short and uninteresting. I don't know who decided that this game is an RPG but this is not RPG."
605,20,"Dont let the Woke agenda make your decisions for you. If you are a fan of the Harry Potter Universe then give this game a shot, it is worth it."
606,33,"A very good game, if a little bugs but you can still play, believes that one or the other update will solve the problem"
607,54,It was a fun experience. Exploration within the castle was the best part.Enemies: 5/10Exploration: 9/10graphics: 8/10Story: 7/10
608,17,"This is one of the best single-player games I played in a long time. It is worth every penny, and no regrets about buying it. Dynamic combat is a good choice of spells. Unfortunately, no morality system is in place, but other than that, no complaints."
609,10,Very good game. Beautiful graphics. Overall absolutely amazing.
610,2,great game im busting
611,30,"Just not worth the money. If it's half the price, then yeah go ahead and play and enjoy it for what it is. Nothing in this game is done wholeheartedly. Everything from story to beasts to game play to optimization is like 30-50% of what it should be to push it up to next level. Nothing is done to it's full extent. The UI for PC is complete garbage, scrolling through spell sets that can only have 4 spells at a time is so bad for game play. Probably biggest annoyance."
612,2,I love it. I love Harry Potter Universe. Worth every penny for me.
613,18,brilliant
614,4,"Nice fun game, really takes you into the wizard world."
615,8,cant fuck house elf
616,3,5 hours in and I'm quite liking the game! I will definitely complete this and update my review later
617,13,its impressive game. for HP fans and not. beautiful maps full of energy. the story is something that is not good or bad. but all other things in the game is magnificent!!!
618,2,"Runs like shit, quite dialogue heavy - wait for patches / sale"
619,6,nice gameplay
620,9,gooooooodddd
621,19,"This game is incredible, the harry potter game ive always wanted! im constantly in awe of the graphics and detail they put into it! they really out did them self making this game! i bet they are proud of the game they have made :) "
622,6,Love this game man - sadly got performance issues on PC but still looks super beautiful even on lower graphics10/10 recommendPS: dont flame the game - flame jkr and her stupid orgs ty
623,10,i pat all the cats
624,19,"It was fun and entertaining, a lot you could do in the game while you were free to go almost anywhere on the map"
625,2,awwoooooo
626,20,very fun
627,6,If you liked the Harry potter franchise you'll feel really pleased and immersed with the game. Its beautiful and I hope they add more to the game like more character customization and spells. Otherwise I am really enjoying the story.

632,14,"This game is fantastic.   FPS I am steady above 60 FPS  usually between 73-112 FPS at most points.  It is running on some medium settings and is still beautiful.  RTX 3070, 16gb ram, i7-12700H.  Game is worth it."

641,27,Some bugs here and there. Overall enjoyable experience.
642,27,I'm not good at writing reviews so just going to say it's very much worth playing especially if you love Harry Potter. Also it works good on the Steamdeck and the controls are good as well for it :)
643,6,"From what I've seen the graphics and storyline are great, there are a few bugs that are expected when the game has just been released, other than that I'd rate this a 9/10"
644,6,Best Game
645,23,"The story isnt very long but still good. The side mission are also creative, which makes it fun to search for them and play them. The combat system is also very well done. I can recommend this game to everybody who like a nice but not too long RPG."

651,2,Interesting...
652,20,"Amazing game, i will buy future DLC, the one MAJOR issue is the unnecessary fps fluctuation, i have a pretty solid PC i mean, hell, i can keep 60fps better on RDR2 but this has some fps drops and it's just annoying but VERY PLAYABLE THOUGH!"
653,34,"aint perfect, but damn if it aint fun"
654,3,great game

669,13,I am in love. It is everything we've always wanted. I can remember imagining this 15 years ago and wishing you could throw spells around. No game has kept me this engaged in a LONG time.
670,2,pretty good
671,38,best game of 2023 by far
672,14,Best game of all time. I love it.
673,14,Great game. Engaging and the exploration is top notch!
674,4,Barely started the game but already having great fun :)
675,6,"Incredibly fun, feels like the books/movies, engaging story so far, world feels magical. They did a great job and the game is well worth buying."
676,3,this game is amazing i just cant play because it wont go past the shaders screen
677,3,Fun game
678,21,One of the best games I have played in years.
679,6,"A beautiful looking fully immersive game that will absolutely delight any fans of the series.  I get the feeling though, that even non-fans, or newcomers to the world of Harry Potter will also love the fullness of the story as well as the beautiful graphics."
680,11,well put together. just make sure you have the right system to run it
681,1,A fantastic game
682,5,Takes a bit to get into the combat but very fun game!

689,19,I downloaded Hogwarts legacy on valentines eve prepared to spend the night all by my self. But at the first herbology I saw her! Professor Garlic. now I have spent days writing romantic poems and sending them to the greenhouse. Best game ever 10/10
690,21,Hands down the Greatest Game I've had the pleasure of playing.  Do yourself a favor and upgrade your computer and get an HDR10 monitor to enjoy it to the fullest.  If you have any stuttering issues most likely you have 16GB RAM and need to upgrade to 32GB+
691,25,One of the best drops in years
692,7,she's pretty right
693,2,you're a wizard harry
694,0,"endless update, can't play"
695,13,"The game overall is very beautiful, But between the many problems that exist and can be easily fixed, such as broom camera locking, frantically searching for revelio pages with little success, and the very basic facial details on npc, maybe hold off on buying it until they give it a good polish"
696,1,tis great
697,35,11/10 Would highly recommend. this is everything your childhood was about and more!
698,6," It might appear that I've only played 10 hours, but I've already finished the game on PS5 :)Beside the FPS issues, this game is a masterpiece "
699,2,Bless J.K. Rowling
700,26,This is a good game really brings you into the wizarding world plus flying on a broom is a big plus its a big open world game give it a try you will not regret it.
701,33,After patch. Take more than a minute to load the map each time you fast travels. Constantly FPS drop makes the game unplayable.
702,25,great game
703,14,This game is stunning! Patches are quick and successful. Highly recommend
704,6,"This game truly feels magical. Never liked Harry Potter but this is something so different.More content, details and passion in any AAA game I've seen"

713,19,You can pet any cat you see
714,5,Don't come to potion class tomorrow
715,37,Hogwarts legacy  is a beautiful game . The combat is really good .
716,7,Best game ever
717,4,Definitely worth every cent.
718,6,"Game looks absolutely amazing, but it just does not work on pc as of right now, unless youre running a nasa kinda rig. It stutters, drops frames even in cut scenes and crashes the moment you even think of blinking. Its like RD2 but about a thousand times worse. Whoever greenlit this game for release on pc in this condition should be fired. Loving the game but this needs a patch ASAP. Should be illegal to charge money for a game as unstable as this. (R7 3700x, asus tuf rtx 3070 OC, 16gb ram, 1tb nvme storage)"
719,15,Great immersion into a world I grew up with. Well written characters and questlines. The world feels like the hogwarts from the movies. Fun and unique combat that makes you have to react and change tactics on the fly. Having a really good time so far.

730,3,AVADA KEDAVRA
731,19,"If you're a fan of the Harry Potter world (and not so much of JK Rowling) then this game is for you! It is grindy at times but always rewards you with cool aesthetic rewards, spells, spellcrafts, etc. Don't expect to see anyone from the movies though."
732,2,i have really enjoyed playing i just finally bought the game and had played three hours straight not gonna lie.
733,23,10/10 if you're a HP fan
734,35,"One of my all-time favorite games now!I just hope that they make multiple DLC's because I just want to keep playing it, but sadly I've beaten the game and all of it's content."
735,8,Me like crucio spell and levioso animals
736,10,Really nice Game.
737,19,"not only the best ""harry potter"" game ever, but one of the best games i've ever played. it helps i'm huge into the wizarding world but even if i wasn't - the game is gorgeous, plays very well and haven't run across any bugs. extremely solid all around!"
738,28,"Many hours to play, and the game continues to be exciting and engaging. It's every bit i could have hoped for. They definitely delivered!"
739,22,Magical.
740,61,amazing game
741,10,Expelliarmus!!
742,14,"a beautiful feeling creating your own wand, thank you for the nostalgic shivers the whole game has its gameplay flaws but the world is as it should be ""Magic"" Thank you and I recommend it"
743,11,"Amazing visual quality and design of the Hogwarts and the world. Quite nice combat. Poor everything else. Repetitive chest grind, mind-numbing boring quests, identical NPCs, no dialogue options, no plot options. Glorified Visual Novel or worse."
744,2,tbh i dont really like harry potter movies. but this game. its so fun. it gives that good open world feel with like also a sorta skyrim feel with the magic and stuff.
745,52,"Don't listen to Twitter, this is the game of the year."
746,5,great game enjoying the open world concept
747,13,just a great game that if you really play it completly it has way more hours of fun than most people think
748,3,Im literally a wizard.
749,32,"Very fun game, endless fun."
750,16,Why the hell isn't Hogwarts divided into cells? We don't all have NASA computers.
751,17,"A lot of fun, I'm not even into the movies but I enjoyed it."
752,9,"Very exciting game, expecially if you like the Harry Potter Universe."
753,12,Herbology teacher = POG open world = so much to do learned how to fly on broom needed to be level 6 did it at level 20
754,39,"I have a 1080Ti and 16 GB RAM. I am very meticulous in keeping my RAM usage low as well. When this game is running, I am using 80% of my RAM on average and it shows. The game does not run well at all. Setting everything to low made it playable, but still jarring with frame drops and assets taking centuries to render already scaled down textures. I have seen other reviews from people similar specs saying they have no issue, so take it as you will. It was fine enough for long enough that I did not request a refund within Steams policy time, so I played it anyways. Do not take my hours played as an endorsement for the game. I would absolutely not buy it right now unless you have considerably higher specs, as players with similar ones to mine are giving mixed reviews. However, if the performance issues are resolved, I highly recommend purchasing it then or purchasing it for console if you must have it right now. It really is a great game and I will change my review to positive if they fix these issues."
755,7,"Genuinely amazing game. Way better combat than I could have expected. Hope they keep making content and dlc for this game long into the future!Would love to get some of those planned but missed features, more areas in the world to explore, etc."
756,45,Fantastic game
757,11,"Nothing to say! That so great. Oh my dream, my childhood."
758,19,This is by far the greatest game I have ever played. The story is engaging and the open world is vast and expansive. You can tell the developers truly cared about Harry Potter!
759,9,wizard go brrrrrrrrr
760,26,Very smooth and very attention grabbing
761,3,When the game loads it is beautiful and a great experience. But of the 10 times I have tried to load the game I have only gotten past the shader screen once. The game continues to crash while loading the shaders and it is extremely frustrating.
762,29,The best open-world game!most of the time I am not playing singleplayer games because I want to enjoy a game with friends (co-op or multiplayer games ) but this game has just done it perfectly for me its 10/10
763,2,yes its pog if you wanna be a wizard
764,30,Pretty Cool that it makes my wand hard
765,11,"Nooo, Just HarryYou're a wizard“LISTEN HERE HAGIRD YOU FAT OAF! I’M NOT A FUCKING WIZARD”"
766,68,Having a blast with this
767,39,"Amazing, perfect!!! i love it!"
768,20,Boring and repetitive. Obviously mainly for kids. But not that exciting. Great story line but I skip all of the cut scenes because they take so long. The map is empty and there really isnt much to do. The game stutters at times but I will say it is beautiful. But I feel like they should have took more time with it...you cant even keep gear because you fill up quick and having a house is pointless because there is nothing special about it - you cant use your bed and there really is nothing special about day/night. Honestly nothing special about the game in general.
769,15,"This game is amazing! It is almost exactly what I dreamed it would be. The flaws are quite minimal, and the scenery alone is 10/10. Absolutely stunning world and gameplay (especially the combat)!"
770,19,"Great fun, amazing visuals, great gameplay and features. only problem is performance and the spell casting bar  (how many spells you can equip and cycle through at once); other than it, it's an amazing game"
771,1,I am wizard.
772,18,Revealio deez
773,7,wand does indeed go soooop
774,27,"I am really enjoying this game! I have and would, definitely suggest this game to friends. I love the open world, the puzzles, and the immersive story line. Its fun to explore the wizarding world as me!"
775,7,Incredible.
776,28,perfect !!!
777,2,Avada Kedevara
778,3,"could be a good game, if the thing ever opened, i have a brand new pc with very high specs and the game wont open, will force my pc to crash on the loading screen. absolute trash on the developers end of quality control."
779,14,It's great.
780,12,Reignited my love for the Harry Potter stories.
781,27,THIS GAME IS DOPE AF. YOU CAN FLY ON A BROOM
782,56,"- No Quidditch.- Missing so much QoL features that it feels frustrating.- Whoever designed the flight controls should be banned from going anywhere near a computer for the rest of their lives.- You don't feel like being a student at all. There are some classes but there are just ""there"", but nowhere close to be a main feature of the game. You become way too overpowered way too quickly, I am pretty confident that at the end of the 5th year (which is only year you will be attending) protagonist can take on Voldemort and win without breaking sweat.- Hogwarts ""looks"" immersive but other than looting stuff there is very little do within it. The things you can interact with is criminally low. There are almost no side activities and chances are you will be seeing your dorm like 2-3 times entire game. I almost forgot where it was.- Outside world is large, again looks amazing and immersive, yet there are only around 20-25 outdoor side quests. Most of it feels repetitive and list of things you can do is again a short one.- Combat. It's the saving grace of the game, extremely fun and executing spell combinations feels very rewarding.- Story feels shallow and short, your choices mostly don't matter and most of the times you won't be given any anyways. There's not much of a roleplaying because devs thought it will be better if they decide what your character think and say most of the situations. It's a very linear experience and there's no replay value.Overall, i think it's a fun yet a VERY flawed game."
783,18,SWISH AND FLICK THE **** OUT OF IT!Jokes aside this game is awesome
784,10,magical fucking game
785,28,as a HP fanthis game feels like a dreamthank you
786,26,LOVE this game!
787,25,"[b] It's not great. If anything, it's somewhat mediocre. I'll personally give it a 7/10 but only for its beautifully crafted world and nothing more. I absolutely love flying on a bloom and take in the scenery from above the skies. The gameplay and story however are just below average. [/b][b]The Open world[/b]Beautifully crafted. Absolutely uninspiring mobile game tier of contents scattered around the maps though.I like the field guide page mechanics, it adds more lore reading to the Harry Potter universe and adds value to the exploration.Having 60 random chests just laying around all over some random corridors in Hogwarts however is quite immersion breaking. Needlessly to say it feels wrong having to break into every single houses in the world just to collect the collectibles. This is not what I anticipates from a ""Hogwarts wizard RP game"" experience.Hundreds of Merlin trials of the exact same 5 puzzles? Caves that lead to a chest that gives you … 16 gold? Not to mention all the doors and chest gatekeeped by random locks, requiring you to suck it up to Gladwin and hunt down moon statutes for 6 hours just to learn Alohomora. The contents in the open world gets old fast, and within minutes you’ll find yourself quickly unmotivated to touch any of them. And the worst thing is the game punishes you for not doing that. Upon starting the game the first thing they tell you is that combat don't give XP, but only completing achievements does. So you HAVE to do these tedious mobile game grinds to keep up with the ever increasing difficulty from progressing the main story.""The forbidden forest is strictly off limits ... except for the dozens of poachers there roaming around like it's some family picnic sites."" But seriously though, why is there so many poachers in this game? It seems like for every 10 Hogwarts graduates, 8 of them choses poaching as their career.[b]The Combat[/b]Half the enemies have this weird coloured bubbles mechanics that requires you to pause the game mid-fight and switch between spells to break their shield before you can deal damage to them. The bubble shield mechanic looks great at first, but it quickly becomes repetitive and frustrating when the game starts throwing groups of 5~6 enemies at you at once, all with a different color of bubbles.And it's even more frustrating that half the time when you cast a spell your character will cast it to the wrong target, meaning now you're stuck running in circle for 15 seconds waiting for the spell to cooldown so that you may attempt to break their shields again.The game heavily synergize on reading enemies movement and countering their attacks using the correct spell, but it rarely becomes a reality when 6 enemies are all throwing stuffs at you simultaneously, with half of them attacking from off-screen.1v1 however is a complete joke even on the hardest difficulty.  The combat offers no challenge when you have the full attention on a single enemy. You'll have the luxury of time and correct casts to counter each and every of your enemy's action. In fact I don't recall myself losing to any of the 1v1 bosses fight.Or alternatively once you realize how powerful RB (RB is the button for throwing objects) is you can simply breaks the game by running in circles spamming RB and stones everyone to their death. Throwing object bypass most enemy mechanics, deals a great chunk of damage, while also giving you precious I-frames in battle. No need to care about your enemy's shield or what they're doing when you can just insta-kill them by pressing RB and fly some rocks into their faces. This is especially true once you learn the transformation spell and can turn smaller mobs into explosive barrels, effectively taking out 2 enemies in each fight before the combat music even starts to play.[b]The Story[/b] [i] This section contains spoilers [/i]Absolute dogshit logic everywhere. Professor Fig can Reparo a bridge but not a book with a few missing pages. [spoiler]Sebastian revealing unforgivable curses for no apparently reasons, when other spells can work just fine in his situation. [/spoiler]Poaching is bad ... unless it's you doing it, than you have the full support from Hogwarts. Doing harm against a Unicorn is a crime against humanity, but when you lock them up in a virtual world and harvest their horns every 20 minutes it is ""20 points for ravenclaws"". It baffles me a lot when professor Weasley asked me to treat Deek with respect, as she and Deek has been working together for a very long time, yet all she can spare Deek is some dirty ragcloth to wear. In fact, all house-elf working in Hogwarts still dresses like a slave with no explaination. Despite everyone is worried about the goblin invasion nobody seems to be doing anything about it. The world is seemingly dead and you're the only person alive trying to stop the goblins. There's just something special about Skyrim where there're city guards patrolling down the main roads and even setting up sentry camps on hills and chokepoints, and you can occasionally sees them slaying wolves and bandits to keep the road safe. The roads in Hogwarts however is just poachers, and goblins, and spiders. But mostly just poachers.[spoiler]The four keepers still trying to withholding information from you and put you up for their trials, even after you've told them some goblin already digged into THEIR legacy and using THEIR power to threaten the world. It makes absolutely zero senses that the keepers would throttle you by withholding information and requires you to work for it, when fundamentally speaking the entire goblin situation is their fucked up and you're just there to clean up their messes.[/spoiler]"

900,24,"good game, you should play"
901,10,"Lets start this off by saying Hogwarts legacy is a beautiful game, its storytelling and environments are amazing.But...This game is an absolute mess.Just to begin with the fps drops and stuttering are nearly constant often causing the fights to be impossible to complete until the game fixes itself up, for however long that is. A re-occurring bug that caused the player to lock onto an enemy or object, while the camera would continue to spin the opposite direction, in turn this making the character roll in the wrong direction or just straight up shoot at nothing.I wouldn't be able to count on two hands the amount of times i was killed by a troll completely ignoring the long dash i do and just appear on top of me doing an attack (not a teleport, just straight up sliding across the floor at light speed towards the character), this wasn't exclusive to trolls just more frequent.While not as common as the other problems i found myself getting stuck inside objects frequently. In often cases walls that i should've been able to scale or climb just wouldn't work, yet i would come back 10 maybe 5 minutes later and i could climb said spot without any issues.But with all of that i still very much enjoyed the game and would've given it a positive review, until of course i load into the game and am introduced to a settings screen, the kind you get at the start of the game. All of my past files (18 hours of game play) were gone, and then magically the game crashes causing the cloud save to update. Now whether its normal for the steam cloud to delete past saves to clear up space or not i can't deal with the fact that i have to redo all of the stuff i had done before.I've requested a refund but don't honestly think ill get it."
902,14,avada kedavra
903,78,This has quickly become one of my favorite games of all time.  Its just behind Skyrim for me.  Absolutely would recommend playing with minimap disabled.
904,17,"Great game, most fun Ive had in a long time."
905,34,It's like a place out of a story book.

910,2,FRICK YOU SJW
911,9,"The game is poorly optimized, sluggish and suffers from constant stutters. Even with the day 1 patch, the game struggles to maintain 60 fps within the recommended developer specs."
912,7,"laggy for a bit until it smooths put, definitely worth it tho"
913,3,rowling very bad. game very good. pretty simple

925,4,ima wizard. its cool
926,28,Wonderful game
927,31,"If you are on the younger side, or just really. really love Harry Potter, you will love this game.If you took the Harry Potter universe and it's nostalgic charm out of this game, you'd be left with another generic open-world puzzle game with an emphasis on collecting hidden items and completing quests where you find 50/50 of some hidden item. The story is bland and generic with no permanent effect on the wider Harry Potter world. Combat is okay, spell combos can be fun and interesting, but the novelty quickly wears off. When there are lots of enemies you spend the entire time dodge rolling over and over in a less than perfect imitiation of Darksouls combat. The best part of getting a magical letter of acceptance to Hogwarts is the new world of freedom and possibility. The exploration in this game is just so structured and regimented that you lose most of that. They try and cover up that lack of freedom and possibility by keeping you busy with endless collection quests.The game is set in a totally new time period with all new characters, and we barely get to know any of them. Only three students have any sort of in depth relationship storyline, everyone else, including important faculty are just an empty robe or obvious archetypal gimmick. Just like when that stupid acceptance letter never showed up for me in real life; it's just lost opportunity.Buy it if you can get it for basically free, or if you have small children who want to watch you play it."
928,21,"Absolutely beautiful game. Great mechanics, fun and addictive gameplay, lots of missions/quests/side-quests and all thrown together with a big-ol' hit of nostalgia! 10/10 would recommend!"
929,24,GOTY candidate easily

944,42,"Worth the hype, the price and everything. Game's a 9, a 10 if you ignore the multiple technical issues (i'm playing with a 3070ti and i7 10700k and I suffer some stuttering and frame drops)."

947,4,I finished my PhD before this game was released. I AM LUCKY
948,17,fun ass game
949,20,This game is one of the best solo story games we've had in quite a bit! Also ur a fucking idiot if you don't buy it. Stfu move on its a video game stop crying. Hope co-op comes in soon!
950,6,Probably the best game I've ever played.
951,16,GAME OF THE YEAR
952,5,"A bit Gofetchy for my taste, but a lot of the puzzles and challenges are fairly innovative. Overall, a very enjoyable game."
953,0,I was so excited to play just for my game not to work... Like i've try and checked everything and it just runs so slow and keep crashing and restarting my pc and ugh i hate it :(
954,16,such a amazing game with great graphics and just awesome details.
955,3,crazy game
956,16,:thumb'sup:
957,7,This game is badass.
958,8,very enjoyable to play
959,2,its amazing game
960,11,"Amazing, stunning, beat all my expectations! definitely recommend this game."
961,20,cool beans
962,11,insanely good if it runs
963,9,"The open world of this game is unlike any other that I've experienced, it is exactly like I imagined an open world to be before I started playing games"
964,12,"good game, but some graphics bugs with face textures and body glitching, should be fixed eventualy."
965,14,Im not sure how a mobile games developer made such an absolute banger of a game on the first effort. 10/10 would genocide poachers again.
966,13,Because its good!
967,2,"3 Hours in and I bearly scratched the surface of this game, I love the graphics and the story has been amazing so far, I would definitely recommend this game, will add more to this review as I go along"
968,18,"I thought this game was going to be a disappointment based on pre-release videos, but when it got some good reviews I picked it up and I'm glad I did!  It's a lot of fun - especially the combat!"
969,30,This game is all you wanted Hogwarts and Harry Potter to be!!! It's a must buy if you are an avid Harry Potter fan! It is just remarkable
970,31,Harry Potter cum simulator
971,13,not bad coming from someone who wasn't really a harry potter fan in the first place
972,10,"I haven't had this much fun playing a game in a long time. Or maybe ever. I was skeptical, but this is truly magical. Just marvel in all the details."
973,19,Just perfect!
974,16,"If this game ran a little bit better it would be in my top 10 favorite games, and I've only seen one harry potter movie and it was the 2nd to last one"
975,25,It's AMAZINGGG!!
976,8,wizard game good
977,21,Story is fine and all but that isn't what I am here for. I am here for the magic and the gorgeous visuals followed by an above decent combat system that can get slightly repetitive quickly but it's still somewhat addicting
978,42,best game ive ever played! 10 out of 10. I just hope its a game they add more to. i want multiplayer and DLC!!
979,32,"shadow money wizard gang, we luv casting spells"

981,33,Solid combat
982,3,"If  you like story telling games this is it, filled with lots of stories and very minimal action, so take it how you want."
983,5,its a great game!
984,7,i love it
985,7,Amazing gameplay though a little unoptimized
986,7,I've barely even scratched the surface and can already tell it's going to be one of the best games I've ever played - even as someone who has only read the first two books. 
987,25,Absolutely everything you could want for a Harry Potter style game! Love the story and the combat using spells is one of my favorite parts of the game. If you're a Harry Potter fan then I'd highly recommend playing this!
988,4,Amazing!
989,14,graphics are nice but combat is terribly clunky its a joke spell binds are just not practical on keyboard not at a fast pace at least also not really open world its more like a guided RPG i dont think anybody expected this to be a true open world game though
990,8,Absolutely awesome game!
991,2,Love it! made me feel like the movies
992,10,Amazing! Lots of Exploration +100 hours of content available!
993,26,"It is so immersive, its like a combination of fallout, dragon age inquisition, skyrim, elden ring.AND WITH FLIGHT! 44 hours in And haven't gotten bored of anything yet."
994,6,Most fun game I played in a while
995,19,My favorite open world game. It will most likely be 2023 game of the year.AVADA KEDAVRA
996,28,I am 100% biased. But i also have ADHD and yet this game managed to capture my short-lived attention span for 45 hours and counting. I've just finished the game and I'm excited to go back at it again.
997,14,"fun combat, immersive world, good graphics, and a lot of things to dohighly recommendedjust ignore the fake dumbass haterswatch The Act Man vid and have a laugh"
998,29,"Don't listen to all the idiotic politics; this is a great game. Graphics are stunning, combat is fun and engaging, puzzles and exploration galore. Truly feels magical. The character creation could be a bit more robust but that's pretty minor."
999,10,This game is peak
1000,22,The most immersive Wizarding World experience and Hogwarts is designed in most Book and Movie-accurate fashion (It felt very familiar and I loved that). A must game for any Harry Potter Universe fan!
1001,54,i am in fact enjoying this game
1002,23,"I CAN'T recommend this game enough! WOW!Such a well crafted game. A few performance issues here and there, but past that it's crazy good!"
1003,26,"This game is worth playing. I dont have much negatives i can think of....if u are Potter fan, i might not sleep"
1004,19,Perfect.
1005,9,"Fantastic game, Stunning Graphics and and awesome story. Loving every moment."
1006,8,An absolute gem of the game that absolutely manages to live up to the hype. You can feel the love that has been put into this game.
1007,2,Fantastic game so far
1008,21,I love it.
1009,114,Worth The wait! A must Play for Any Harry Potter Fan
1010,18,This game is magical.
1011,19,So much to do. It's fun love the puzzles. I am not even through with the story and I never know what I should do next.

1021,21,"Far better than I expected. Fun combat and a good story, even if you're not a HP fan."
1022,35,This game offer a Magical experience
1023,1,arry potta
1024,44,I'm a what?
1025,7,Its a fun story base game even without the deluxe edition. I recommend this game.
1026,6,"The original hype an awe died down, the only reason to get this game is if you want to explore the school. Outside of the school seems really boring with repetitive puzzles thrown it to make it seem like there is stuff to do, and the combat is really easy.Only get this if you are a fan of the Harry Potter series and want to explore the castle."
1027,14,"Laggy and unoptimized, but fun as heck, especially for Harry Potter fans like myself. Feels like a genuine love letter to the series. Wish the author wasn't horrible, but I can separate the art from the artist and enjoy this game."
1028,9,"I wasn't a potter fan, but now i am. this game could be great... but WTF did they do?!this last patch is terrible and after 15 hours of loving this game. logged back in and.. IT'S ALL GONE!!!!! The amount of legwork needed to find and possibly restore lost or worse to find out there is a corrupted game file is beyond the pale for a standard user to want to endure to play a game uninterrupted. I dealt with it but its more than enough to ruin this game for so many peopleWTF?!  How is this acceptable.... a lot of people are losing everything!!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY TILL THEY FIX THIS BEAUTIFUL PILE OF EXCREMENT"
1029,18,god this game makes me nut
1030,13,Good Game.
1031,25,you can get a mod that makes avada kedavra cast into the voldermort meme
1032,42,"its a nice game, but the main story is too short for the price charged. dont think its worth the price for the hours of fun"
1033,11,Love it.
1034,40,I'd buy it to listen to the soundtrack alone.
1035,1,"So far a really fun game if you're in to Harry Potter and the universe. Getting to explore the castle, Hogsmeade, etc. is just really cool."
1036,8,"Hours of fun, definitely recommend if you are a Harry Potter fan or just like fantasy RPG"
1037,29,TLDR; Open world game with actual shit to do.
1038,2,"JKR , best story , thank you ... also, a great game WB!"
1039,8,"bro i have 14 hours on this one save and it deleted itself twice, im so pissed right now and i dont know how to fix it. i swear on everything right now if i cant get a refund im going batsht insane."

1048,3,really REALLY good game. worth the price. long story. good graphics. except. 1 issue. HORRIBLE optimization. my game is always stuttering. please fix this and itll easily be a 10/10 game.
1049,2,Very exciting! walked right into another adventure from my childhood :)
1050,27,Can't get enough of this game! Definitely the nostalgic aspect is what puts this game up there for me.
1051,30,It's like Skyrim meets Harry Potter.  I'd give this a solid 9/10.  Really well done.
1052,25,"Draco dormiens nunquam titillandus,"

1064,25,"The writing in this game is amateurish. At one point a professor is asked if he thinks there could be other goblins working at the bank which can't be trusted. He responds something along the lines ""Oh no most goblins are decent folk and want nothing to do with Ramrok"" even though there is no reason someone would immediately assume that given the circumstances. Another case is when one character is recounting an event where one of your enemies cursed a child and right before he did it he says the words ""Children should be seen not heard"". It was like the writers asked themselves how can we make sure the audience really understands that this guy is evil but didn't stop to ask themselves if the line fit the context of what was happening since the child neither spoke and the curse didn't remove her ability to speak. The beginning of the game did start off pretty good but soon devolved into a nostalgia dump with zero depth. You can only speak to other characters when they are a vendor or they have a quest for you. Hogwarts and Hogsmeade are interesting at first but that's where the nostalgia dump comes in. They show you all these references of the books but pretty soon you realize all those references are on a short loop. About 4 hours in I had already seen everything of note in these locations and really wished I had gone out of my way to unlock fast travel points so I wouldn't have to run through the same uninteresting environments over and over. I would recommend this only if it had a steep discount AND you're really interested in walking around Hogwarts and Hogsmeade for an hour or two because the only thing this game does well is putting you in the world of Harry Potter it's terrible at immersing you in it."
1065,5,"things are a bit buggy and some frame rate drops in areas, but overall definitely a great game thus far! love the story, combat and you get to ride a F****ING broom!"
1066,18,GOTY 2023 easy
1067,35,"Fantastic game with a lot to do. Don't rush it's not that type of game, sit back and enjoy the ride you can break 100 hours. Between the modding and the dlc I have high hopes for what this game will be."
1068,32,It makes me want to be a wizard haha
1069,6,"As someone who never really cared for the books nor movies, I'm interested in the book and movies now."
1070,27,"Amazing game, great mechanics, no annoying bugs - this one is a complete and total home run! Really fun game, great writing and I can't wait to get back to it to see what happens next."
1071,2,"That's awesome. The environment, physics all of them is pretty good."
1072,22,Its a fun game
1073,2,Actually good
1074,10,everything
1075,7,Its a great game for story line and if you like HP. This game is full of adventures side quests and much more. This game is also great bc you can create more than one character to enjoy different houses story lines
1076,37,"I would wait until the next patch were they fix the stuttering and frame rate drop which wasn't an issue before the patch on 2/14/23 which seems to have completely broke the game for slightly older hardware. Played for about 50 hours pre-patch on low settings and had decent graphical detail(not potato faces like now) and load times were only a brief second before entering a new area. If I had given this game a good review, it would have been only on the fact that it had quite a bit of harry potter lore. This game as a open world rpg although, meh. Any immersion feels very lacking. Just a repetitive content game without real rewards for the grind time. What point is a legendary item that gets replace with a similar level green item at the same level? What point are npcs if they don't react to anything? All characters outside of quests just follow a simple script that gets super repetitive unless you are on a quest, this goes for the scripting your character as well. I feel there is zero reason to replay this game if you can get it to play and do decide to complete 100% with how repetitively dull it becomes in the later half of the game and with only a single quest difference between the 4 houses. I also don't ever want to hear the word revelio ever again!"
1077,19,You can go Avadika BLAP BLAP!!
1078,21,Amazing!!!
1079,19,A professor is making me go out to collect Troll Bogeys 10/10
1080,15,"24 hours in and after the new update my save was completely wiped. Pretty unacceptable for AAA. It looks like my autosave file are still in a save folder but the game refuses to recognize. Pretty crushed, but be wary PC users."
1081,16,never watched any of the movies or read any of the books but this game is really good
1082,8,game good
1083,10,Game changer thanks for this BRING an Multiplayer options all my friends play I want to interact with them in some way even if its not the main story line !!!
1084,18,It's a prettyfun game i havent actually played an open world RPG in awhile. story's pretty good theres a lot to do it feels like i'm only around 50% done with the games story and i've sunk about 32 hours into it. there is ALOT to explore which is why i'm not finished with this game yet at time of review.
1085,6,so far an all around fun game. i love it
1086,50,"Excellent game, wish there were more spells as well as a coop feature, but the overall story and pacing of the game is amazing and makes it feel as though you're stepping straight into a Harry Potter book."
1087,5,Your a wizard Harry
1088,31,its a decent game in 4k ultrawide
1089,14,SUCH A GOOD GAME JK ROWLING IS THE SHIT
1090,9,Meets all my expectations!
1091,14,I wished this game wouldn't be a flop. I got my wish. Thank you.
1092,19,we love casting spells
1093,30,Game is way way to repetitive and just throws a shit tone of stuff over the map to make it feel like there is alot to do love this game but damn its so disappointing
1094,3,"You get to live out your wildest fantasies, embarking on strange new adventures in the magical world of England, portraying yourself in the strange journey as your average British person!"
1095,38,"i love this game way to much haha, it has a few flaws in my opinion but all in all i think this is incredible."
1096,2,"Just a few hours in so far. The world is amazing, game is super immersive outside of demographic realism from 1800s England, story seems good so far. Combat seems pretty boring so i'd mainly recommend this if you want to explore the world. Only writing this now because of a significant number of bugs. Couldn't initially play at all on Steam Deck, would crash immediately across several proton versions which luckily didn't break the completely unnecessary and anti-consumer drm limit. Also have been crashing/freezing about once or twice an hour mostly related to fast travel even on a gaming pc.If you're going to charge 60+ dollars for a game I don't think it's an acceptable release state and would avoid buying it until it can be made stable through future patches."
1097,9,Lovely well made single player game. Kudos devs
1098,21,simply fantastic
1099,5,"Fun, detail is amazing."
1100,2,"made for console, not worth the money"
1101,23,Great game! Spent many hours so far just exploring. The story has been great. Overall I recommend.
1102,17,Game released in a smooth manner and has had few problems since. Overall gameplay and graphics were well thought out and provided an enjoyable gaming experience
1103,21,Its a fun game.
1104,13,Loved it so much
1105,2,"Other than the game being slightly laggy, the graphics are beyond beautiful and the story sucks you right in. Just started and I haven’t moved because i’m so invested. Definitely worth the hype."
1106,4,Stupefy!
1107,19,game is amazing
1108,26,"Brilliant game, enjoyed every part of the play through - Worth the money spent."

1125,2,DAS IS GOOD
1126,7,"This game is fantastic, looks great and the combat is fun unique and engaging. just needs some patches for pc performance but that can partially be put down to running it on an older system (rx580)"
1127,0,"Game was dead on arrival for me and many other PC games. After going through many steps to have it wok with my PC I decided to return the game. I not waiting for a day one patch the game should work at launch, i'm tired off buying product that doesn't when it it is released. Brought Dead Space with my refund and I'm completely satisfied ."
1128,5,"If you like the wizarding world, this is for you."
1129,3,im not black :(
1130,5,great game!
1131,7,you're a wizard harry
1132,5,"As a person with Yennefer as my profile picture, I might honestly be done with Open-World Titles.After completing Persona 5 Royal, this game doesn't grab me in the same way at all, and to be honest, I think most of that revolves around the fact that these types of games don't have the strong, story-driven sense of direction that other linear titles such as Detroit: Become Human do.I'm not being edgy, this game just completely fails to capture my attention even in the slightest."
1133,18,Overall an amazing game! Great if you love to explore.
1134,33,EVERYTHING IS AMAZING
1135,5,Looovveee this game!!
1136,31,Wow. What an amazing game. Looking forward to see what the devs add in the future.
1137,14,"I never watched a Hairy Pooter movie but I am still enjoying this game, nice open world stellar graphics nice rpg system, What more could you ask for. Maybe I will watch the movies now."
1138,10,Solid game. Cant be evil tho
1139,2,Niiitidoooo
1140,26,I was sad you couldn't avada the annoying charters UNTIL i discovered you could blow up bridges built with reparo while they walked over them.
1141,1,The game will barely run on the absolute bare minimum graphics. I've requested a refund even though I was really looking forward to playing this game.
1142,12,you can kill with magic
1143,16,Pet ALL the kitties
1144,16,This game is amazing!! PLEASE ADAPT AS AN MMORPG!!! @lockkeygames I would be a lifer lol
1145,14,Amazing game the magic is satisfying to hit and the world never gets repetitive with exploring
1146,7,"play game, very good"
1147,13,It's magic!
1148,5,The Witcher 3.5
1149,14,"hogs' meat, here i kum"
1150,1,The game is very well polished and really makes you feel like you're at Hogwarts! Can't wait to play more of this game!
1151,15,Fun game - Limu
1152,22,Great gameplay and chock full of lore. Excellent for anyone who loves the Harry Potter series.
1153,23,This is the best game I've played since Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
1154,2," Great graphics, the story line is interesting./ All the characters you meet are fun and they remind you a lot of the book characters. It's been a very enjoyable game."
1155,11,"VERY solid game without being into harry potter but even better if you are. graphics, gameplay and story are sweet. flying on broom is cool. map is sized well for the content, no empty spots on the map."
1156,7,"Story is great, so many hours of gameplay for what you pay for.  The camera angle and controls take some getting used to, but overall, very well done.  Feels like a very in depth Harry Potter version of Fable (which is a compliment)"
1157,2,"terrible game doesnt run well at all is super laggy and framey, would not recommend getting this game till they fix it"
1158,14,Excellent game! hours of content. Fk anyone that tells you not to buy this game.
1159,33,"Amazing. Wizards, Cats, Spells, Puzzles, and Beasts. Go for it!"

1163,18,"Hogwarts Legacy is on par with the expectations I had for it, amazing game."
1164,34,Great story and fun game to play
1165,8,"your a wizard,**********er "
1166,6,This game is like if you took Skyrim and mashed it together with the Harry Potter universe. Exceeded my expectations.
1167,30,"great game, beautiful graphics"
1168,3,yes this shit is peak
1169,14,It's the Hogwarts experience I always wanted! I am having a blast exploring every nook and cranny!
1170,6,I'm a wizard Harry!
1171,19,spell go brrrr
1172,33,I just finish the game and what i can say this game worth every dollar u will pay.
1173,8,mad immersive and fun ... i love it
1174,28,"Yes, the DEVELOPERS made an amazing game. GTFO With all the political bullshit."
1175,25,"A love letter to Harry Potter fans and a generally great game for everybody.Finally,  a AAA game that released in a polished state in 2023 is a breath of fresh air and I'm glad it was this one"
1176,28,"Game is a ton of fun, really makes you feel nostalgic about your childhood if you are a 90s kid"
1177,18,love it but hella buggy on pc until some patches come out
1178,1,Not optimized for PC so i refunded it.
1179,21,Surprisingly great game. A lot to do.
1180,16,optimization is bad. Cant use ray tracing even though i am capable of it. frames drops too much to be enjoyable with ray tracing on. But the game is very good. Nothing  but good on story and graphics
1181,18,Its good
1182,17,*me every 30 seconds* REVELIO!!!!!
1183,22,good but the choices you make in-game don't make much of a difference in world
1184,6,If you are a Harry Potter fan this game is a must play! The views!
1185,3,Is good.
1186,16,> Came with low expectations> Left after a 10h session
1187,17,fun and enjoyably
1188,8,A lot of content. Have some fun!
1189,5,I dont know you fly around with a broom and what not
1190,10,"Great fun, a mix of dark souls and dragon age inquisition.  Wait for some DLC or a sale tho unless you're a die hard HP fan."
1191,2,good game yes
1192,20,The game does a great job capturing the wizarding world and would highly advise anybody who has interest in Harry Potter to play this.
1193,8,"Very fun, although I did feel they could've done more with the magic portion. It's just hitting a button to cast a spell, I was hoping there would be a little more to it (e.g. combos, joystick directions)"
1194,5,Body ody ody ody ody ody ody ody
1195,8,"1. Joins Ravenclaw, Excels in Ravenclaw. 2. Finds path to dark side.3. Becomes absolute badass.𝐇𝐨𝐠𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐬 𝐋𝐞𝐠𝐚𝐜𝐲 𝐔𝐧𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐞𝐝"
1196,1,"Would appreciate less hand holding and exposition. Other games do a great job of telling the story while letting the player do something, something this game seems against. Limited to walking speed in most instances, and other exposition dumps are done in cutscenes that don't seem to flow naturally."
1197,39,"The game has worked for a grand total of 33 minutes, since early release. It then crashed, and has since never made it past the loading shaders screen. Since the loading shaders screen is counted as play time, Steam will refuse a refund based on the basis of too much playtime. So, 70 dollars for 33 minutes of in game time. Seem like something you still want to play?"
1198,16,Game is broken cause it won't let me save my game's progress a week into it. I've reinstalled it multiple times as well. I paid for the deluxe edition and I expected a deluxe version but that isn't what I received. I wish I knew the game wasn't going to work at all cause I would have never spent a dime on it.
1199,2,epic transphobia momentalso it is actually fun with great combat
1200,3,Hey! That's pretty good!
1201,60,You can pet every cat you see.
1202,4,"Overall an amazing game, really fun to run around and story has been amazing so far"
1203,16,double u
1204,10,"Reminds me of the very first time I played Skyrim on the 360, without all the random shit flying around with a mind of its own. Castle is gorgeous on the inside!"
1205,1,10/10 you can pet every cat in the game
1206,11,This game is great for people who love the open world games and or harry potter. Make sure you device meets the requirements before you buy how ever other wise there may be some problems.
1207,5,an npc said i had beginners luck so i used crucio on him
1208,36,great game
1209,15,yeah i got sucked into the game...small bugs but they dont crash the game so i'm fine...i'm vibing
1210,26, I AM A WIZARD
1211,24,AVADA KEDAVRA IS OP AF
1212,7,I'm a wizard
1213,2,Very FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1214,4,"Love the story but there are so many stairs in this game, going round and round. Never played a game that make me sick before because of stairs >.<"
1215,9,The game is just simply really good.
1216,6,Love the game when I get off 11 hour shift to BSoD and freeze and crash fuck yea lets go avada kedavra my fucking ram
1217,35,0 bugs 100 percent blew away my expectations   buy it
1218,3,"Really want to like it.  I really do, but it's so poorly optimized it's not funny.  I can run any other game in my library on Ultra, but I have to run this on the lowest setting just to be playable.  The game still freezes and stutters when entering new areas or when enemies ""surprise"" you and the game has to render them quickly.  Just another terrible PC port."
1219,2,taking forever to update.I couldn't cooka da pizza
1220,9,I love the casual game that still has action.
1221,54,good game
1222,8,"Very fluid gameplay, minimal load screen times and really only when you fast travel. The only thing missing from this game is online co-op/multiplayer. Outside of that I give it a 9.9/10"
1223,65,Must buy!  9/10
1224,36,yer a wizard
1225,2,I'M A WIZARD 'ARRY. Was really impressed with the game... then i left Hogwarts and couldn't believe how big the rest of the world is. Hogwarts is only a small fraction of it. Really immersive so far.
1226,4,So far enjoying. One annoying thing is always finding new gear that is ugly as hell and having to hide it or make it look like something else when you equip it. There should be an option to stay as you are when equipping.
1227,32,Petrificus totalus.
1228,4,Surprisingly good combat.
1229,4,It is so immersive.
1230,7,avada kedavra!
1231,3,Great game! a ton of fun and not too demanding on the computerd
1232,19,It's a solid 7/8 game that is brought up if you enjoy harry potter at some point in your life. The story is pretty weak at times though and the world building outside of the school is just not there at all. Main issue I have is the pc port is absolute trash and I feel like reviews should be dunking on it more. the stutters are ridiculous even on a pretty high end 8700k 3080 pc. No settings can improve anything in certain parts of the school or hogsmeade.  Probably the worst pc port in a long while. I'd say people should definitely wait for some actual performance updates or pick it up on ps5 or series x instead.
1233,11,Feels like the old Harry Potter PC games reborn. It's fun.
1234,14,great game :)
1235,33,I need a Mooncalf plushie.
1236,6,"Dialog is a bit clunky, but it's overall still well written. The puzzles are great and the combat is interesting."
1237,8,Best game I've ever played!
1238,7,10/10 greatest game of the year. Even if you have never seen Harry Potter you would love this RPG.
1239,4,It reminds me of fable but with wands but such a great game though
1240,20,"as a raging homosexual, this game is pretty dang good"
1241,5,Snape Snape Severus Snape Snape Snape Severus Snape Dumbledore
1242,18,Super fun game!
1243,35,Greatness awaits you
1244,22,i mean the games actual story quality and gameplay are top notch but the fact the textures will just lose render constantly gets old pretty quick. 2D hagrid graphics dont have the same effect in 2023
1245,17,its a really good open world game and even if you beat the main story there is so many side quests you can do its crazy I do think you should get this game
1246,7,this games amazing
1247,18,Very goog.
1248,17,"The world is immersive. The map is huge. The game is a masterpiece. Also, I get to brush and feed what is the equivalent of a Ty Beanie Boo. Life is good."
1249,7,"i swear im not transphobic, i just really like this game"
1250,19,"If you love Harry Potter, you'll love this game"
1251,24,great game to lose yourself in
1252,15,It is good.
1253,3,"Do not recommend currently, due to the below reason.Terrible performance issues on the high preset, despite my PC being more than capable of running it at Ultra at 1440p.Thought things might of got better after the patches, but it just hasn't changed anything at all.Very disappointed, and can only hope they get things sorted very quickly.---Will come back to this review if and when they fix the FPS issues."
1254,4,Fantastic game! Depending on future updates and DLCs could definitely win GOTY.
1255,14,Perfection!
1256,21,AVADA KADAVRA
1257,13,"Sprawling world filled with fun and mystery. However, the AI for the enemies is atrocious, load times through doors can be slow and some flying mechanics are clunky."
1258,15,game of the year 
1259,25,"With its highs and downs, definitely the game all the Wizarding World fans were expecting!Great potential for expansions/dlc and a sequel."
1260,14,We LOVE casting spells 
1261,17,Awesome Game
1262,2,It was very fun and it has so much freedom so u can control the story and make it yours
1263,10,its good
1264,19,F AMAZING
1265,22,Never knew being transphobic could be so much fun 10/10.
1266,21,"Even in Hogwarts, I can't get away from the stealth assassin build. Loads of fun."
1267,11,fun game
1268,27,i really am a wizard Hagrid
1269,7,"Fun, open world, live the movie out like I dreamed I could"
1270,1,Pretty fun game. Glad to see so many people got together to praise the game and cheer on streamers wanting to play!
1271,15,Very good game.
1272,17,A must play for any HP Fan out there!
1273,3,AVADA KADAVARA
1274,17,THERES NO QUIDDITCH! YOU BETTER PUT IT AS A DLC
1275,6,"Game is great. Didn't expect such a fully-fleshed out open-world RPG. Runs great on steam deck, on my PC (3080ti, 9900k) not so much.. definitely looking forward to fixes.."
1276,7,Fantastic
1277,21,absolutely blown away..this game is a 10/10 a deserves all the praise it's receiving.
1278,22,BEST GAME EVER!!!!! SLYTHERIN FOR LIFE!
1279,73,its an amazing game
1280,34,The game is as great as I imagine and expected it to be. Really glad I bought it.
1281,23,The lore and story were my favorite part of this. This could of easily been a movie on the big screen. Only half my field guide is done so pending further review. It could be a while..
1282,2,really amazing game so far but perfomance could be better
1283,23,Does it get any more cosy than Hogsmeade?7/10
1284,7,"It's not RDR2, but it's the best game since that game. I loved uncharted 4 and COD MW had its moments, but the lore of the wizarding world puts this in its own space. It's a great game."
1285,44,It's pretty good
1286,6,"Highly recommend, only thing I would change is adding quiditich to the game."
1287,2,is very good play game is fun time if u hav time for play game funtime
1288,2,"YES, JUST YES!"
1289,7,mama mia
1290,2,such a great game...just buy it already
1291,97,"9/10 only because no NG+, must have though"
1292,22,great game love the graphics much better then the last game but lego is still fun af
1293,10,Incredible.
1294,14,Avada Kedavra
1295,0,game crashes before getting to the main menu
1296,11,"Positives: combat is fun, music and art style are well done, and the voice acting is solid.  Negatives: some graphical fidelity issues and too many NPCs look alike.Overall: 8 out of 10 - a fun RPG Harry Potter fans will likely enjoy."
1297,28,some minor bugs here and there but overall a great experience.
1298,18,SHADOW WIZARD MONEY GANG
1299,10,The game is a must have for any harry potter fan. it is very fun and its many post game activities keep you busy after the main quests.
1300,9,Very nice i wizard
1301,27,This is exactly the wizarding experience I was searching for it was worth every penny and only 45 hours into the game.
1302,24,avada kedavra is a good one to quiet the women and children
1303,6,"iT is soo much fun, highly recommend"
1304,6,Spell binding / switching could be better3rd person camera is a little close for my liking.  Just a fun game
1305,3,most anticipated game for me finally exploring wizarding world
1306,38,its everything i could imagine and more. Except for no quiddich. thats a bummer
1307,14,"it was fun, 2/3rds of the way through it switched from hogwarts game to generic open world rpg-lite"
1308,5,awesome game that brings a new breath into the harry potter franchise
1309,54,a magical experience.
1310,8,topperson
1311,5,aviddy kevilly. 11/10
1312,11,"This game perfectly captures what Harry Potter would be in the late 1800s. Its game mechanics are easy to learn and fun. The graphics are also absolutely stunning. If you are a fan of Harry Potter, this game is perfect."
1313,5,"wasn't expecting much, but is nice and entertaining. Its a must buy if you are running out of things to do in other games."
1314,23,Elden Ring for infants and noobs
1315,3,Everything.
1316,2,great game when it can run without lagging my system or crashing. its great and when it runs it runs very smooth with RT on. but even with high end hardware like my 3060 TI Laptop OC gpu. it still even dies. I love the game but hate the fact its unplayable
1317,9,"Gameplay is snappy and fun, and exploring Hogwarts is awesome. The level of detail is insane as the art team carries the game. Characters and story... meh, but I'm here for the spectacle!"
1318,10,"Looks great, plays great and you can tell a lot of attention was paid to the details to make it really feel authentic."
1319,9,alex alvear
1320,6,pretty good. just realized you can do magic
1321,45,Very fun. Very magical. I only wish you could romance the centaurs
1322,6,Even if your not a Harry Potter fan this game is great just as a game. Amazing settings. Combat is fun and demanding. Lots of side stuff to do that every ADHD person will just love. Also flying is always a win
1323,29,Very good game
1324,4,A very good game can't wait to get a broomstick.
1325,23,this game has exceeded my expectations. my only disclaimer to give would be that it may be difficult to stop playing and be productive in reality.
1326,2,"This is a new and refreshing take on ARPGs. I'm not even a Harry Potter fan, but truly enjoy playing this."
1327,2,"Very slow pacing and the combat feels uninvolved and unrewarding. A good majority of story moments and quests felt very neglected (poor VO, animation, fetch to progress busy work, etc.)Simply not my kind of game."
1328,14,Very nice game!
1329,0,"Downloaded this game on steam and was excited to play after waiting 4 hours to install. The game opens and crashes on the loading screen and does not work. If we're paying $90 for a game, it should at least work properly. I am so mad that purchased it. worst decision ever."
1330,49,The game that Harry Potter fans have been waiting over 20 years for. An excellent start to what should be an excellent series of games.
1331,15,best game ever!
1332,14,"Game is great!  Love the combat, and there's just so much to do.  Has some performance issues which I hope will get patched out.  Regardless, this is the game I've wanted since I was in Jr High."
1333,2,BEST GAME
1334,22,Incredible gameplay with an amazing story and world.
1335,37,10 POINTS TO SHADOW WIZARD MONEY GANG!!!
1336,45,THE BOY WHO LIVES HAS COME TO DIE....Avad-
1337,34,Extremely Fun!! wish it was multiplayer.
1338,6,"Stop reading, start playing."
1339,11,"Honestly, this game is a delight, an amazing experience for fans and non-fans alike."
1340,15,"Finally, someone had the stones to say what we've all been thinking: goblins are working with criminals, undermining our society, and you know what, I'm not comfortable with them controlling the financial sector either."
1341,2,"yer a faget, harry!"
1342,32,"Very good all around game.  Story, graphics, and game play is super fun.  Highly recommend."
1343,11,Don't let the muggles get you down.
1344,45,"Absolutely phenomenal game and well worth the purchase. Already looking forward to additional DLC. The team did an amazing job recreating Hogwarts, balancing explorations and combat, and fleshing out a truly great story."
1345,13,[i] Revelio [/i]every 5 steps. My character became Lara Croft by going to explore tombs. One of the best games since I played Shadow of the Tomb Raider.
1346,34,"Really good game, highly recommended."
1347,14,iforgot how much i used t o like harold potted
1348,26,"Excellent game, exactly what I have been waiting for from the Wizarding World. Really hoping for some DLC as I don't want the story to end! 10/10 would buy again."
1349,23,"Great game, totes am wizard, runs like shit though"
1350,3,Runs very poorly even with great computer specs. Game runs on 60 fps then drops to 10 and so on. Even on Lowest graphics it runs like crap. Disappointing.
1351,7,very good game that is all
1352,4,Attention to details is crazy. Every door leads somewhere and can be opened. Great game.
1353,2,Beautiful game
1354,8,Wonderful sandbox game :) Might be a story attached but got distracted patting cats
1355,16,Even though JK Rowling sucks; the development team did a pretty damn good job with this game. Very enjoyable and lots of interesting characters. Hoping for DLC in the future
1356,22,"I like how most of it is accurate to the books and movies. It has a fun game play to it, had to use a controller, keyboard and mouse was too wonky. once I got used to the controller I became more adept."
1357,13,amazing game!
1358,16,Broom go fast when me want it to and spells make the bad guys disappear like my dad!
1359,12,Game of the year hands down
1360,44,"I've ever had a game literally crash to the point of being unplayable.  I have a 3080, PC way above specs.  Every 5 minutes it crashes, taking MY ENTIRE D DRIVE with it.  Like I need to go into disk management and do a rescan to reconnect the D drive after Legacy crashes.. wtf fix your game  for PC"
1361,22,"Graphically beautiful with a large world to explore. There's a lot to do outside of the main quest line, I've probably spent more time on side stuff and exploration than I have actually following the story."
1362,22,"This game captures every essence that made the OG games as special as they were, and more. Game of the Year worthy 110%."
1363,54,Excellent game. Well worth the hours invested and buying price.
1364,2,good game
1365,19,Can't kill innocent NPC's. no multiplayer. dont buy
1366,25,"This is one of the best games that i have played in years, this is a really good open world RPG"
1367,1,Very good
1368,26,Deek thinks you should buy this game
1369,10,A Dream come true
1370,6,yes very well good game 10/10 :D
1371,2,The best game
1372,4,"Lock, the game is good,but as steam only have yes or no, right now I dont recommend it, the game is stuttering and have FPS drop all the time, even in high end machines.I recommend wait, get a discount and a fixed game."
1373,2,when you do the sorting hat it reads your mind and picks your favorite house!!!!!!!!!!!
1374,12,Good shit. Exactly what I wanted from a hogwarts game. Kinda wish it had quidditch though
1375,26,"One of the best games I've ever play. A couple of things to get better but nothing mayor, hope to see quidditch and the multiplayer world as well."
1376,8,Very fun and relaxing game.Performance can be pretty bad at times unless you do a few fixes yourself.
1377,26,This game lives up to all the hype. I couldn't stop playing it and was sad when i beat it. So many things to do even after finishing the story.
1378,2,bad optimization
1379,19,Best game ive played in years!
1380,8,only problem I see is that you cant sex professor garlic
1381,16,good soup
1382,13,Better than Destiny 2 PVP
1383,2,"Shadow Wizard Money Gang, We love casting spellzzz"
1384,28,Everything you thought it would be and more
1385,4,"I enjoy the game, but it deeply disappoints me that in buying the game, I'm supporting a terf."
1386,5,Best Harry Potter game yet hands down
1387,4,im trans and love this game
1388,18,"I love this game. The only things I doesn't have for me are Quidditch and multiplayer. If I could get an MMO version of this, so I can play with my friends, that would be the ultimate version of this game."
1389,32,yeah this is great fuck whoever says otherwise
1390,16,love the game
1391,7,Muuuito bom!
1392,1,no
1393,8,I recommend this game even if you have the minimum  system requirement i have a bit over it and it plays well sometimes there is maybe a visual glitch or two but it has good gameplay and a very good story and a very pretty world even with the lowest settings.
1394,8,"fun story, really puts you in the world of harry potter"
1395,4,Great game
1396,17,"Amazing game, one of the best I've played in a few years. Some small performance issues but never during combat when it matters."
1397,8,"It's good in my opinion good amount of gameplay ,BUT one thing I would add is you can sell plants and potions"
1398,24,"I beat the game until the hidden ending ""lvl 34"" the start of the game is great, you can see the devs put in good effort for 3 hours of content [to get past the return period on steam], after the first few hours, the game progressively becomes more grindy by making you do pointless objectives.You have some outing quests with your companions, but their stories do not end in a satisfying way, and feel very rushed. They do not have any impact on the ending of the game. Meaning their worthless.The ending is none existent, with a trivial boss fight, and no pay off to your character or the wizarding lore. Likewise Hogwarts itself is hollow with no real secrets. Unlike even Prisoner of Askaban by EA which released more then 10 years ago- which has more secrets and hidden pathways. Classes themselves are time skips with the exception of the first 3, which the devs built. It is clear this game needed another 2-3 years to be completed, as 60-70% of the story occurs in the first 15 hours, the rest is filler and fetch quests.Likewise. the performance is questionable, i had to install two mods of nexus to fix the frame rate on this .game.  This game is a solid 5/10. It has a story- albeit bad- it has gameplay, but none of it is unique in any capacity, it has bosses [all can be one shot by a single spell], and there is no progression. Buy on a deep discount or if you have nothing else to play right now."
1399,27,"If you like the Harry Potter universe, you're bound to like this game !"
1400,26,Amazing game!
1401,23,Professor Garlick😭😭
1402,20,best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i am not racist or sexist or whatever i just want to be a wizard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1403,28,worth being a transphob
1404,31,A lot of puss y on the streets .
1405,8,harry potter ogm
1406,15,"An absolutely beautiful game, In our favourite ""Wizarding World""!"
1407,3,"I'm sad about this game. I am not what you'd call a massive Harry Potter fan, but I grew up with the books and the movies and it seemed like a very fun escape to that childhood memory, and if it WORKED it would be that for me and many others. But, as it is now, I literally cannot enjoy this game. It is so unbelievably, horribly optimized on PC. The game is borderline unplayable. I have a 3060 which, isn't the most powerful card on the market, but more than enough to run this game. At low settings, with DLSS on, it becomes a powerpoint presentation if you enter ANY combat, load a new area in the castle, literally CUTSCENES will stutter and lag. Until this game is updated to be playable at all, I cannot recommend it. Release your damn games functional for once."
1408,58,"I love the game! but I can't recommend the game because I feel like the story is too short and it's heavily story driven. It felt like once you acquired all most of the spell the fun is already over.. maybe that's just me, though there are other ways to enjoy the game by either Room of requirements or exploring the rest of map and doing marlins puzzle... ""Nobody wants to do this"" maybe doing side quest but they are mostly fetching quest. If you wanna play this game and have read the books, watched movie even a fan of the Harry Potter franchise you will surely be disappointed."
1409,14,gameplay is really good. just the character is so lifeless which make me dont want to dig the story.
1410,30,Revelio!
1411,21,10/10 game best single player game in long time need more games like this that are open world
1412,2,"Amazing game, fairly GPU hogging, but i have a 3060 Ti with 16GB ram, and it works at 130+fps on medium and 60+ on high, but it looks amazing on medium! even on low?! If your a potter fan (Pott-Head) you should enjoy this a ton!!"
1413,11,"Not the biggest Harry Potter fan, but this game is right up my ally. Exploration, RPG mechanics, open world, side-quests, loot, all of it. love it."
1414,13,Amazing game
1415,7,Its dope
1416,18,Slytherin the way to go ;)
1417,13,Merlin himself would be proud.
1418,4,good game try it
1419,18,"Love the imagery and design. I think the devs did an excellent job at weaving J.K. Rowling's universe into the gameplay (e.g., using the Floo network for fast travel)."
1420,35,"This is a wonderful game,  very repayable a lot of fun."
1421,25,"ignoring all the hate and  what not. I  love this game, there are wonderful characters and  quest to do, everything is just breath taking."
1422,15,"I sold my items from Dota 2 to buy the deluxe edition n spoil the story to my friends, the best decision that I made in my life."
1423,30,I love wanding people all over my school
1424,17,"Best game I've played in a while. From the music to combat, everything is on point. The open world feels alive. Would've liked more intractable characters in the world but all in all it's a 10/10"
1425,14,Am i gay?
1426,6,pleasantly surprised by the LGBTQ+ representation.
1427,30,"One of the best games I've ever played, I will admit I didn't think it would be as good as it is but I was proven wrong."
1428,3,This game is probably one of the best if not the best rpg ive played in the last few years.
1429,13,absolutely love the game lots of fun and always looking forward to get back on the next day 100% would recommend getting
1430,8,shadow wizard money gang
1431,8,best game of the year
1432,8,This is the greatest HARRY POTTER GAME ever made. I just love exploring the castle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1433,22,game is good but last update performance make me can't use ultra. i have to use low to play without lag. pls fix it.
1434,4,Great game all around. Rare to have a game that's actually worth the price. Thank you!!
1435,12,This is the best fetch quest RPG of 2023.
1436,13,"There's so much to do, you'll lose track of time!"
1437,16,My girl said its her or the game...i been having a great time playing with no headaches lol!!!
1438,9, Wish I could jump over railings and fly in doors and in close proximity to hogsmead and Hogwarts.
1439,13,Has to be GAME OF THE YEAR!!
1440,16,An absolute masterpiece. You could get lost in this game world. I would highly recommend!
1441,3,Great game
1442,16,at some point this game will save you into a glitch where you cant move or open your menu. hour 27 for me. my only option is to restart the game because it overrides every other saved game but the last few. therefore if you load your game twice to not be stuck in a wall you will have to restart the entire game.   the game is super fun and im so very angry that my only option is to restart the entire game.   I have never felt like a video game owes me money before. 24 wasted hours with no way to not be suck in a wall is stupid.      
1443,3,You can hit cats with your spells
1444,11,"a great piece of lore, for the harry potter universe and the best up to date game they have available..go SLYTHERIN!!"
1445,16,"I feel like I got enough time in to give this a fair review and its kinda meh. I thought this would be like a Mass Effect- your choices matter- or Skyrim -open world so free you can ignore the actual storyline forever without ever getting bored or Stardew Valley idle style RPG but its not.  It feels like a whole bunch of filler and like 20 interactable NPC's. Even enemies feel sparse, not that it matters as combat doesn't give exp, which also doesn't matter because there isn't a proper talent tree but more of an unlockable perk system.Without a way to really craft and customize your character (even the creation options are presets), it doesn't feel like you are forging your own path but just plodding along the route the devs pinned you in. The most fun I had in the whole game was setting up my room of requirement and catching beasts."
1446,2,Haven't played much yet but so far I'm really enjoying it.
1447,4,really like the game and the things you can do in it.
1448,4,funte game
1449,14,Your a wizard! Lived up to all my expectations.
1450,6,It's amazing to finally have an open world game that takes place in one of the most exciting fantasy worlds ever conceived of. The story isn't bad either.
1451,8,Really good single player game!
1452,18,Best Game This Year
1453,10,"not a harry potter fan, but this game is the tits."
1454,2,Amazing 10/10
1455,4,its an incredible game. buy it you  wont regret it
1456,5,"Literally one of the best and most beautiful games i have ever played. You don't even notice the loading in between areas, its so fluid. If only Quidditch was in the game. Absolutely love it."
1457,7,I say yes. Despite some minor issues the game is great.
1458,20,100% must play if you like Harry Potter
1459,6,YES DEFFO PLAY (BTW I LOVE TRANS PEOPLE)
1460,7,Great game with excellent mechanics. The graphics are beautiful and everything is incredibly immersive. The story-line is excellent as well.
1461,13,"An incredible amount of effort has gone into making every detail significant, not just those details you normally focus on.  I'm not a really big Harry Potter fan, but I can surely appreciate the effort that has been placed into this game."
1462,5,Excellent game. The optimalization still requires some work but overall - Super fun!
1463,21,perfect!
1464,2,Very pretty world and brings back childhood memories
1465,19,Nearly der nearly der
1466,2,i love being a ethnic wizard

1468,29,Amazing Game
1469,4,good game 8/10
1470,24,Best Game Ever!
1471,20,What we have wanted for twenty years. If they release a sequel and let you choose your light/dark path we could be looking at the next great fantasy franchise.
1472,34,tHERS NOTHING ABOUT THIS GAME THAT i CAN SAY i DISLIKE.
1473,21,"such an amazing game, I'm roughly 27 hours or more I think into the game and I finally beat it, i'm level 31 and it's just been such a wonderful experience. absolutely recommend"
1474,7,"Game is fine, Steam is not.  Continuous updates that fail on Steam.  I've played 10 hours, but have spent nearly 30 downloading patches that don't work, at 35GB each.Downloading... 100%unpacking... 100%installing... 1%rinse and repeat.  Xbox version works fine."
1475,11,"Great game, i really enjoy the combat system. the quests are fun to do and character interactions are incredible! there are some bugs with puzzles that can be a bit annoying. im sure they will get them fixed however! definitely worth playing though!"
1476,30,"just a great game what else to say, game of the year"
1477,25,This game is simply the best.Better than all the rest.Better than anyone.Anyone I've ever met.
1478,7,its very good other than some lagspikes here and there
1479,16,its Hogwarts whats not to love? im 30 hours in and i cant put it down
1480,31,If you levioso the cats and then spam them with basic attacks you can send them across the room.
1481,51,love this game. Highly recommended ♥
1482,4,"It's a beautiful, excellent, and fun game.  And it works great on steam deck, but also flexes the power of my gaming PC.I haven't hit any bugs yet."
1483,6,Potter stinks.
1484,25,"This is the most amazing game I've ever played. Its beautiful and magical, constantly giving you new content all throughout the game. The attention to detail is better than I think anyone could of hoped for."
1485,16,my little burglar: stealing is magic
1486,4,amazing but need a good graphics card.
1487,4,better than I expected it to be
1488,22,"Great game, don't pull a bag down in front of a zone in/out area. You'll get stuck and cant get out."
1489,25,"Fantastic game, if you played ps1 harry potter games, you will have a delicious nostalgia playing this game"
1490,34,Amazing graphics and gameplay. I love the story I really got immersed in it. Some issues with how my characters voice sounds like. 9/10
1491,25,"Even when i think i want to take a break from this game and go play a different game, i end up starting this back up. It is SOOOO addicting! Always been a Harry Potter fan since i was a kid. Good job WB! 10/10 highly recommend"
1492,17,aaavaaadaaaa kedaaaavraaaa
1493,4,My Hog Has Warts
1494,1,im racist
1495,6,holy this game is fantastic. Way better than I thought in every way! might want to wait for a sale tho cause its a bit pricey
1496,8,WHY ARE YOU WORRYING ABOUT YOU-KNOW-WHO?YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT U-NO-POOTHE CONSTIPATION SENSATION THAT'S GRIPPING THE NATION!
1497,18,Awesome Game
1498,39,"Things we need, New game +, Respawn of named enemies and loot chests, Quidditch, Otherwise this is the best game I have played in a very long time and it has sooo much more potential to be more than it already is."
1499,8,avada kaadvra monkey.exe activated
1500,46,Haven’t touch grass since it came out
1501,7,very nice
1502,2,Awesome game!
1503,23,"i read books, watch movies, played lego games, and now became the big man in this world? FUCK YEAH, AVADA KEDEVRA BABYYYYYYY!!!"
1504,6,this game is amazing
1505,14,Amazing game!!
1506,4,"I am 6 hours into the game and the world and combat is where this game shines. Why I am not recommending it is because of the performance issues I have experienced. There is whole lot of stuttering, environment loading, and FPS drops. They come up when exploring, in combat, and even during cutscenes. It takes you out of the experience. I am more than willing to change this to a positive review when this game is patched but for now, the performance issues are making it unfun to play."
1507,19,great game but needs more patches for better PC game play
1508,9,"Best game Ive played in around 5 years, Fantastic, however depending on your experience the game can either have no-nearly no performance problems or can have severe problems."
1509,2,"Great game, fantastic music, and I dont give a damn about the boycott."
1510,27,it's great
1511,58,"love the game and lore, can pretty much explore the whole HP world"
1512,1,denuvo sucks ass
1513,13,"YoU'rE a WiZaRD, HaRrY!"
1514,7,This game has been wonderful. Despite the awful writer behind the books- it brings me so much joy and nostalgia. This game is something i think weve all dreamed about since the first movie.
1515,6,"Story feels very on rails, could do with consequences for accidentally setting people on fire etc"
1516,28,"Crashes a lot, the last boss is a bugged mess of a fight."
1517,3,a great welcome back to hogwarts and to experince the magic yourself
1518,13,My childhood dream came true!
1519,11,It is my entire childhood dream come true.
1520,20,"As a child reading the books 20 years ago, living my fantasy is a dream. Thank you."
1521,12,Very good.
1522,19,nice rpg
1523,32,you're gonna go to hogwarts and do spells n shit
1524,30,This is going to be game of the year
1525,14,"its fun, think the witcher but with hogwarts"
1526,39,i don't understand why it's better to blast people into a thousand pieces or to burn them alive then avada kedavra someone but... yeah AWESOME game.
1527,7,fantastic game
1528,26,"Deek goated, Sebastian goated, professor Fig goated"
1529,10,magic wand go WOOOOSHHHHH
1530,3,its cool
1531,6,"super fun, lots of things to do, beautiful landscapes, quests that arent too grindr. 10/10"
1532,1,Great game so far
1533,2,i like it
1534,35,back out and save frequently... lost several hours to glitches :/
1535,16,This is the best thing I have ever seen out of all the Harry Potter games. I thought it would be underwhelming but it is the coolest open world I have played.
1536,29,Awesome game.  Was happy to help out with the genocide.
1537,2,I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!<3
1538,18,Best single player game I've played in a long time
1539,14,There is no costumer support for new players. I have played my self into a situation where  game is unplayable.  I will have to buy the game again from another company so I can complete the game. Steam is a waste of time.
1540,82,i love this game.I preordered it and i do not regret it
1541,20,"Divertido pero repetitivo, si te gusta el universo HP va... hasta ahi"
1542,2,SOOOO FUN
1543,13,Amazing game especially if you grew up loving Harry Potter and wishing you could have gone to Hogwarts references to things from the book and attention to detail is wonderful
1544,7,Enjoyable
1545,17,Always wanted to imagine attending Hogwarts and this game does it for me. Great fun so far!
1546,10,"no spell to summon some women unfortunately,but good graphicsalso dont buy from steam, it'll save your wallet"
1547,20,Big time grind RPG (only if you want it to be). Amazing open world with so much to do. Great game.
1548,2,"havent played much yet but im gonna give a ""careful"" warning already for those who think about buying it. cons so far:- graphics arent that great for a big game in 2023. played horizon zero dawn (game from 2017) just before this and gotta say that one had 10x the graphics of this. - that ^^ wouldnt be as bad as it is, if the performance wasnt also pretty bad. i have massive screenstutters (even in cutscenes lol) reported by others as well and my PC is savebuild with 3k investment. 3080 graphics card. 16 core prozessor, 32gb ram, best SSD etc. other games run smooth as **** with better graphics. even hyped modded skyrim or minecraft.- the narrative is for stupid people. ""oh look a door, what may be behind it, perhaps the secret this room contains"" -kinda style. you see smth, they tell you what you see as if you were to dumb to know what a door is and that there are generally things behind a door. - the players voice (at least in my female one) sounds very electronic as if an AI from other games was talking. - you cant - forfucks sake- move away more than ten meters from the quest NPC you have to follow or a super unimmersive big fat red countdown will appear warning you to stay near NPC  AND just ""kill you"" if you dont lol. it simply resets you to the latest save point. - the shaders are super bad for a new game, any other new game i played had supreme lighting / shaders. these load in late, flicker, have shadows/light where there arent supposed to be any, LODs are loaded in chunkily, etc. - the hogwarts castle looks pretty dead IMO. yes they planted lots of NPC schoolmates in there with little clichee events when you walk by, but they just do their thing and dont interact with you much besides some cringy forced dialogue from chosen NPC. many students look like the presets from the character menue, very unimmersive, most objects (like a globe you can interact with or such) are copy pasted up to 3 times in the same room, many rooms are big but besides random books and globes and same looking NPC completely empty. its like those forests where there are random generated stones and grass and trees but nothing else, ya know? empty. - cant help but think that the rocks look like b-movie props. no real corners (to many smooth edges), the colours are off, the material reflections are off, etc. - somehow the player has almost no personality so far. she acts like an NPC walking behind the narrator. ""narrator"" npc draws a wand, we draw a wand. we cant do shit on our own, seem to only say ""yes"" and repeat rethorical questions aka have no opinion. - the only combat i had so far locked my camera quite a bit in one direction because the room wasnt spacious enough, while there was no indicator to block if smth attacked you from behind. - every telescope is pointed towards a colored, milky window with NO possibility to look through at all lol. so unimmersive. - grass grows on rocks without any dirt, looks offputting weird. also clips through many objects- the 3 spells i learned so far dont do anything if you arent ""supposed"" to use them. for example: in a duel you can cast levioso to make others fly and your standard attack to damage them. if you try that anywhere lelse you cast it but noone or ""anything"" gives a fuck about it. students wont even complain they just do nothing when you fire at them. you cant lift the bookstaples or globes or plants or skeletons (deco) that you find in hogwarts, etc. its VERY unimmersive. if you kill in chicken in skyrim they massacre you. try shooting an arrow or a fus roh dah on an NPC and they wont act like you dont exist. (just to compare). - most objects arent destructible (book staples are) and spells only leave marks for 2-3 seconds before disappearing. could at least last until you reload the zone. - you cant jump or climb over reilings even if they arent high, you cant even jump from anywhere (cliffs, etc.) if you wanted to. unimmersive (also takes the need from being careful or respecting heights)- you walk into boys bathroom as a girl? no one cares. would have been a good opportunity to hide smth good in both bathrooms and make the need for you to drink some potion to go in their as someone else or come at night or whatnot. there is just so little love to detail in this game which it needed IMO. - cant even make a feather-pen(?)- sry im german- float with levioso. sad. - so far i couldnt talk with any of the countles moving pictures in hogwarts. they also dont care if you fire magic at them at all. pro so far:to be honest i think the high rating score comes from harry potter fanboys/ girls independt of the game-quality. only thing i like so far is the sound and the story is ok (even if badly narrated from NPCs that treat you like some blind bimbo). hope there will be some more as i keep playing, i might update comment.- side missions were decent so far- i like most architectural designs (ceilings, room / floor designs, etc.)- the flying pages are neat.  feels  immersive- the ""butterfly pictures"" (dont wanna spoiler) are decent. feels somewhat immersive"
1549,14,This wizarding game apparently promotes hatred and intolerance! ....Hatred and tolerance have never been so fun! 5/5 I can murder people as a teenager and no one cares!
1550,5,This is a good game
1551,45,Amazing RPG
1552,3,its aight
1553,4,Long intro to the story / exploration but once you learn a few new spells its an extreme maount of fun
1554,3,honestly i have been waiting for a new wizarding game since the last game and this is everything and more
1555,21,Really F***ing Awesome!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
1556,37,it's like bully and breath of the wild had a baby. awesome game.
1557,17,A-MAZE-ZING!! All that needs to be said...
1558,15,i want to be a wizard >:)
1559,12,I loved the booked and movies and this  game did not disappoint!
1560,17,really enjoyable game if you have a high spec pc this is your new benchmark game
1561,9,"It's a combination action, adventure game and is extremely immersive."
1562,7,amazing game!! only problem is some fps drops from time to time
1563,11,every cat i saw i petevery edible thing i saw i ate
1564,4,"Game doesn't work at all. I can run multiple heavy games at once and my pc is well above requirements yet it won't let me complete the tutorial with the lowest settings. Been trying for the last week now and steam doesn't even let me refund it,"
1565,28,Game is magical.
1566,5,This game is fucking awesome!

1574,1,any Potter fans dream game
1575,22,"Decent RPG even if you aren't a HP fan. Obviously more enjoyable if you are a HP fan.7/10, combat is fun, story is okay, lots to collect if that's your thing. Few weird audio bugs, but other than that no bugs experienced."

1578,18,"Even though i'll never get back the Christmas morning Halo 1 feeling, this game gets pretty close. Finally a game that allows me actually enjoy gaming again."

1583,5,very gud
1584,42,just got my PC been on Xbox this game has made my gaming experience amazing the story is amazing the combat mechanics are perfect for the style of the game definitely a 10/10 for me
1585,36,"Expeliarmus! Really though this is a super fun game. Every time you think there can't be more to do, there is more to do. I am doing the Gryffindor play through now, but am excited to try the others later. Definitely a good purchase!"
1586,34,Best game ever for an Harry Potter fan !
1587,2,YES GAME GOOD GAME BIG HYPE
1588,24,"I love this game, I am blown away at the level of detail, the sheer scale of this world that J.k. Rowling built. WOW, I am blown away!"
1589,23,Sometimes it feels like all roads lead to hogsmede
1590,8,"Right now it is amazing, cozy, wizardy. I do hope, that they will expand the world with GOOD DLC. Seeing the cosmetic items I am doubtful what the future holds. Don't make it a money grab, please. Make great content and I will gladly spent more money."
1591,8,Its Fun just want Multiplayer.
1592,20,"My gay best friend bought this game for me. 10/10 not gay, but if he lived near me, I'd prolly blow him. GGWP Game of the year must have."

1596,17,AVIDI KAVIDI
1597,10,I cant recommend this game until they fix the FPS and stuttering issues. My rig exceeds the minimum requirements by a fair margin (though not by a ton) and the game is basically unplayable even on the lowest possible settings.
1598,18,i love it
1599,11,the hype was real i didn't  think it was possible
1600,3,fun wizard game

1603,12,Exciting and imerssive gameplay that will have you running around just to feel like a wizard in jk rowlings world what an amazing expierience that i believe eveyone should give it a go the only down side is that it needs multiplayer and quidditch
1604,22,another game that i will eventually 100%
1605,21,A fun game with a great story and little throwbacks to the novels that will make any true Potter fan smile.

1615,61,Its a good game
1616,23,Sebastian story line is the best of this game :)
1617,55,wizzaerd
1618,4,Just yes like yes 1000% yes
1619,5,AMAZING!!
1620,14, I think this is honestly one of my most favorite games I've ever got hands down everyone needs to play it
1621,3,"So far, this game is great in my eyes. There is so much to explore and roam and has a decent amount of side quests as well so it does not feel like you are flying by in the main story. You can also make your character as nice or unpleasant as you choose."
1622,10,this game is amazing graphically intense and fun
1623,12,"This game would have been exceptionally great except for one fact. You are a student at Hogwarts. The fact that you are a student at Hogwarts makes 0 sense to the game. You spend most of the time not even near the castle and hardly ever interact with your fellow students. Most of the RPG systems don't really make much sense as a student. Why is my character attending class dressed in full plate armour? I thought Hogwarts was known for their nice uniforms? Uniforms in a school don't work with an RPG armour system like every other RPG known to man has. How is your ""armour"" supposed to look progressively cooler when every student is supposed to look the same?Also, why are the teachers encouraging a fifteen year old to explore the country side and burn every poacher, bandit and dark wizard alive? Avada Kedavra, quote from the wiki - ""When cast successfully on a living person or creature, the curse caused instantaneous and PAINLESS death, without causing any injury to the body, and without any trace of violence."" But no, how dare you cast such an evil spell, here, I know, burn the man alive so he can suffer before he dies, if he dies at all, lets hope he lives so he can suffer for the rest of his life!Why am I so lonely in this game all the time!? Where are all my friends and class mates? These characters are ALL boring which is okay because I can't spend any real time with them apart from a quest here and there. There is nothing special about any of them except for Sirona Ryan who's voice sounds like it was recorded from a speak and spell and is so out of place I had to download a mod to hear the ACTUAL TRANSGENDER ACTRESSES VOICE which sounds perfectly normal and lovely btw. But then if they didn't make her voice sound like a robot, nobody would have known she was transgender! Oh no! Thanks for the out of place BS. It truly did not make the game any better for me and really seemed shoehorned in.I'm on PC why am I switching to more action bars. I have at least 30 buttons on my keyboard that aren't bound to anything I could be binding them too. Combat, while still fun yet easy, would have felt a bit less clunky if they included PC only options such as that, which doesn't seem like it would take that long to implement, but what do I know, people only make these sorts of changes in mods all the time...Finally, there is a TON of misinformation about houses out there. Before I played the game I've heard ""‎Gryffindor has the most side quests and Ravenclaw has the least"" and ""Every playthrough is different depending on which house you choose!"" Literally none of that is true. A single quest changes and some of the characters may or may not comment on your house... sometimes... maybe. That's it. 99% of dialogue is the same and besides that one quest, none of the game cares what house you choose. I'm gunna be honest, I didn't really need all that but if every single side quest is just an errend with no real story to it (The other children took my smelly marbles aka gobstones can you go find them for me? Yeah, that's not a story, that's busy work), maybe you could have tried a little harder here. I think I would have been fine if the house really only changed the color of your clothes IF the side quests were really meaty and had actual story repercussions but if all they are is a list of tasks to complete then where the hell is my house content?!?!?They did nail the world though, which for me rings very hallow without all of the stuff that they left luke warm. If you don't care about a games story and if you don't mind that most of the game doesn't make much sense, then this game is for you, but it seems that most people don't mind that stuff. I do.Oh yeah, and my character running around repeating Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio everywhere he went sure was immersive. Can you imagine a scene where Harry Potter is running around repeatedly casting Revelio, messing with all the random crap around Hogwarts? ""Harry, why aren't you in your bloody class?"" ""I need to find all the butterflies around Hogwarts and take them to their mirrors so I can collect their pages.""If this game didn't have Hogwarts in the title, nobody would be playing it."
1624,15,I thought that this game wouldn't be as great as it is. The story line is pretty good and there is a ton to explore. I thought that the combat system wouldn't be great but it turned out to be pretty good. Definitely recommended
1625,13,amazing game love the story also would love online mulit-player mode in the near future
1626,4,as a trans person this game is fire
1627,23,Avada Kadavra
1628,8,"An amazingly detailed game, actually fun collectibles never had that before in a game, good quests and side quests, great combat."
1629,6,"game in unplayable now, got into the forest and now the game freezes and runs at 10-20 fpsotherwise game has been good so far. needs fixing."
1630,10,"Good for what it is, not as special as everyone seems to make it out to be.If you're not a big Harry Potter fan you probably won't get far."
1631,3,The game is great especially if you are a Harry Potter fan. Obviously there is a lot of baggage with supporting this game. Do what you think is best.
1632,13,Avada Kadavra
1633,12,awesome game

1640,13,"I absolutely LOVE this game! It is one of most immersive game experiences I have ever played. If you like the Harry Potter films and books, get this game."
1641,15,"I'm really enjoying this game, there's a lot of side quests and things to go do on your own if you enjoy exploring. Some things can be quite challenging so it is nice to change out of difficulties if you're a more casual gamer like me."
1642,8,"very nice exploration, kinda badly written"

1662,4,"I'm having fun with this game.  The world is very detailed and looks great.  This game had the best marketing campaign of all time.  It was risky, but certainly paid off."
1663,29,"Really not worth it, I have a ton of playtime because I want my monies worth, but its a classic ubisoft kind of experience. Ridiculous and annoying amount of side quests that are not interesting and deep but shallow and meant to extend playtime, a metric ton of quest lines about collecting random things to pad out the worst and your quest log, the main story is lazy and forgettable, the best part of the game are the spells and combat but even the combat gets repetitive and difficulty is only changed by an enemies amount of health, making ""spell"" sponges on higher difficulties."
1664,15,very good
1665,9,Biddy Bad Bass
1666,32,"Pretty good, Needs harder combat."

1693,16,Dope Game
1694,17,"20hrs into the game i can no longer play without making a new save, due to clipping issues. loads then i fall through the map. no keyboard inputs will register until you fall through, even then you cant open the menu so you have to F4 out. Shame. will not start over after paying $60 what a waste unfortunately."
1695,11,Fun to play and lots to do and discover. I love it!!
1696,2,best game i've seen in awhile

1701,4,wand go brrrr
1702,8,you can pick up cats
1703,55,"I have played 87 hours as of writing this review. I can say categorically that there are plenty of positives to this game. Unfortunately to my taste the cons outweigh the pros in this instance...allow me to elaborate.Pros:1. A seemingly vast world to explore - When it was teased that you would be able to fly to anyplace you could see...I admit I was skeptical. However it seems my skepticism for the most part was unfounded, and delightfully so! It is true if you can see it you can fly there for the most part. Of course there are boundaries that are in place to keep players inside the rendered world. That is simply a limitation of gaming we must at present accept. 2. A fully realized and expansive Hogwarts Castle - I commend the developers, art team, and coding team for the painstaking time it must have took to create Hogwarts within the confines of today's technology! Points for all houses! The numerous little nooks and crannies of Wizarding Lore kept me busy searching for hours! Well Done!3. Meaningful choices - this becomes a touchy subject as there were times I was glad that the options seemed to favor a more cooperative approach toward others even if the choice sounded cold and apathetic. As a Ravenclaw, I felt obligated sometimes to inform some that their choices didn't take all options into account, but wanted to do so with an understanding tact. Though I must admit, were I playing a sinister Slytherin this would have infuriated me to no end. To not be allowed to be as devious and diabolical as possible; would leave me feeling that my choices truly were not my own. That instead of interacting with the world as was promised, I was yet again simply watching another Harry Potter film.4. In regards to Required space - Again I must congratulate the teams on their diligence and hard work! The Room of Requirement feels alive and acquiescent to most of my needs. Sometimes though it felt a little too acquiescent. Once one gathers the spellcrafts for the refining table, the hopping pots, and the cutting tables one begins to wonder why one would need leave the Room of Requirement. Not to mention once the Vivariums are unlocked. A meticulous and resourceful Witch or Wizard would find nearly all they need inside the Room of requirement. Save for a few ingredients, however as the Room is supposed to provide anything the student ""requires"" I must defer to J.K. Rowling and give this a Pro designation as the room does exactly as advertised! The only other thing I could nitpick the Room of Requirement for would be the lack of space to decorate, and seeing as how I wanted to spend more time in the Room I consider this to be indicative of a net positive!Cons:1. My how time flies - I was elated to see the Jack-o-lanterns floating inside the great hall! I could almost smell the pumpkin pasties and the butterbeer! I wanted so much to simply spend time sitting in the Great Hall having a good nosh and a chin wag with my fellow Ravenclaws...however there was one niggling little quest I wanted to clear out before I could feel accomplished enough to have some down time. Once finished I was returned to my room only to wake and find that snow had covered the ground and the pumpkins were gone. Replaced by garland, lights, and holly.  Overachieving sometimes does not mean overall enjoyment! I place this at the top as close as I can to the Pros as it was more my fault than anything else, though I do wish the game would have warned you that the season was about to change and hence allowed you to stay a little while longer.2. A friend in need... - Though I enjoyed the friendship quests immensely I felt left with a sense of eh at the end. I shall not spoil endings for others but suffice it to say the climax and the conclusion of most felt rushed and half baked. Points from all houses for causing me to care for someone; only to be summarily forgotten by those that called me a Friend for Life.3. Diminishing a return - Again I won't spoil an ending for anyone but suffice it to say taking the spotlight off a great achievement in gaming is a no no. To not reward the player for a hard fought win, but making them feel as though they wished they never embarked upon a journey is the antithesis of good game design. However the worst thing a designer can do would be to have other non-player characters never again mention the sacrifice or heroism of the character and only laud the obligatory NPC that followed along.4. Pockets full of potions...and other such things - Inventory management was half my game play. I was actually punished for not clearing out my inventory! I had recently learned Alohamora and was happily unlocking all things bound when I came upon a door. I unlocked it and inside was a large chest that I knew would give legendary gear. I opened it immediately knowing that whatever it was it would be a boon to help me in my coming quests...Only to be told I had no room for more gear. I quickly deleted a green hat I had been holding onto to sell once I had returned to a vendor; alas once the space was cleared the chest was already opened and did not reset as lower tier chests do. The gear that lay in wait inside had simply vanished with no option to get it back. That began my obsessive compulsive need to always open my Field Guide and delete anything of lesser or lower value. This is not how I wan't to be spending my time at Hogwarts. I'm a witch not someone's house elf taking stock of inventory!5. High flying abhorred - Flying was fun for the first 10 minutes of play. Though to feel as if you are getting anywhere at all you must either make use of flu powder or insure you upgrade your broom as quickly as possible...and don't bother using your mount. I felt as though I was trying to fly a Magic School Bus instead of a beast capable since birth of soaring through the skies. No thank you leave me my broom and Ill just take the scenic route. At least the view is nice.6. The procurement pension of a Pack-rat - I wasn't sure whether I was playing Hogwarts or Pokemon. With all the collecting in this game I feel that was the only mechanic that was completely fleshed out. Collect pages, collect spellcrafts, collect upgrades, collect ingredients, collect moonstone, collect pets, collect my sanity at the next Revelio cast it needs a break. This truly was a game only meant to give the player information about set pieces found in the world, combat and quests seemed to be an afterthought.7. You're a gambler Harry! - Because the chests give rewards based on a random loot table you may find a level three upgrade right out of the gate, or you may not find a useful upgrade until you are nearly finished with the game. This directly inhibits the players style. I found plenty of cursing upgrades but my Ravenclaw detests the Dark Arts! Not that she didn't learn the curses. Sun Tzu and all...but she would never use them! Thus these upgrades are not only worthless to my character but tempts me to change my style of play because I don't know when I will get better upgrades. If the devs simply placed appropriate gear in appropriate places or made upgrades something the player creates this would have been an easy Pro.7. A tale as old as...never mind its done move along - Again I will not spoil for others...My complaint is that with something as large as the main quests seems to want to take on; the climax and ending do not even equate to the subject matter. There is plenty of build up then in the blink of an eye it is over and dealt with. The Main story line was rushed it was hastily thrown together and the player can feel it. There is no sense of gravitas. There is no sense of impending doom, or threat around every corner. There is no more substance to them than go here and wham-o! Ok, now that that's done; back to class everyone! It was sad and completely forgettable! Were I Rowling I would disown this bit of storytelling would that someone could call it that."
1704,2,It stutters so much for no reason even when I set it too v low settings waste of my money until they fix it.
1705,3,Really great game with outstanding graphics and a very interesting storyline.
1706,11,"You're A Wizard Harry, Mudblood"

1708,2,ive loved it so far a few bugs but its a new game its expected at this point
1709,24,"Beyond fun, honestly one of the best games I've played in awhile. Everything from the battle mechanics to story line. A must play title!"
1710,60,It's alright
1711,9,I was not expecting for this game to be so good
1712,26,I was worried it would fail. But it lived up to its promise. I love this game!
1713,4,"Engaging, nice aesthetics, fun!"
1714,2,"This game is very fun! Even if you aren't a fan of Harry Potter, this game is very neat!"
1715,3,This game is truly magical!  The character movement feels natural. Combat is fluid and feels satisfying. Hogwarts feels like the Hogwarts presented in the movies.  the world is detailed and beautiful!  I'm really enjoying this work of art!
1716,29,"Main quest is trash, but side quests are immersive & stay true to the spirit of the harry potter books."
1717,2,Price is higher than the FPS you get.
1718,8,This game is great just buy it
1719,11,Strong GOTY contender
1720,31,"Play it, you won't regret it."

1724,4,Amazing! Best game I have played in years
1725,10,"Extremely good game. Satisfying combat and a beautiful and complex world. The story of this game is decent and best and boring at worst. Unfortunately, it struggles from extreme performance issues.Overall, a solid 8/10. Heavily recommended"

1735,8,LGBT friendly game! You can make a man with a female voice :zany_face:
1736,9,"The immersion is unlike any other. Exactly what I had hoped for in a HP game. The attention to detail is incredible, let alone such a beautiful game."
1737,3,Brilliant game so far. I love the puzzles! I just wanna play more!
1738,2,"Game is unbearable on 3070 as of the moment, until they fix the stutter and lag then I will start up again. Played 3 hours and cannot return the game because I have tried every thing to fix it but this is a known issue for pc. I hope they address this."
1739,2,"Literally unplayable! So far I've spent 4 hours across multiple attempts starting with launch and haven't even been able to get past the shaders compiling, despite having well above the minimum required specs. This has been a terrible launch and really ought to have been delayed with these kinds of issues. I know many folks are able to play so far, but a not insignificant number of people can't even play yet due to bugs and crashes. I'll likely update this when I FINALLY can play the game as I have high hopes from other reviews."
1740,28,Amazing game with amazing visuals.

1750,11,"You get to shoot people with magic and stuff, pretty cool if you ask me. Also you get a pet hippogriff which is a cool bonus and a house elf. You are now a fucking wizard. "
1751,3,"It's just a fun game overall, honestly, it fills my wanting to be a wizard any day of the week"
1752,3,Great Game
1753,5,SO FUN!!!!
1754,8,It's a pretty chill place with lots of sound clues that keeps you hunting.
1755,6,A movie.
1756,18,Would be an awesome game if it wasnt a lagging POS. Cannot play it with it lagging so damn bad
1757,5,"Performance isnt always the best, but the game is wicked!! love it so far"
1758,8,You can fly on a broom... What else do you want in your life?
1759,19,Im a wot?
1760,5,This sh*t slaps
1761,21,great game
1762,3,"I love it. It's interesting and you get to do all the Harry Potter nerd things (i.e. Hogsmead, Olivander's to get a wand, sorting ceremony). You get to customise your character and learn spells. I'm not very far into it, but so far I love it so much."
1763,45,So much to..... so little time
1764,33,good jod10-11/10
1765,17,Unfortunately the game has soft locked me after 18 hours of play. Seemingly for not reason or any performance issues all of my characters files are now stuck on an infinite loading screen when trying to play. I cannot recommend as this is a game breaking issue that is seemingly happening for no reason and has also managed to corrupt all the files for this character including other separate location saved files I had made as a back up.
1766,1,but mine is very laggy
1767,33,"great game, terrible npc though."
1768,25,"Love the game! Runs a bit bad with my hardware, but still realy awsome. Think the game realy plays best if you are already into the Harry Potter franchise tho."
1769,6,good game
1770,8,Hogwarts Legacy is EPIC! the world is so detailed and huge. Highly recommend
1771,24,Been wanting this since Lego Harry Potter
1772,12,What a great suprise this game is!
1773,3,Definitely exceeds expectations
1774,4,him take mi moni and him gib me wand ;DDDDveri kewl gaming.

1776,18,"I'm a Witcher ,Garry"
1777,2,Sehr gut!
1778,8,Good game terrible fucking frame drops.
1779,28,"Quest ""Take the biscuit"" is BUGGED, pls fix it asap.The locked isn't there"
1780,14,A student said they wanted to get rid of Professor Garlick for being muggle-born. That student was mysteriously Avada Kedavra'd.
1781,31,By far one of the best games I have played in a very very long time. Will be doing multiple play throughs. story is amazing and the game mechanics work flawlessly.
1782,10,Solid game.
1783,26,Vingardio levirrôla
1784,16,Good game
1785,8,Absolutely Brilliant.
1786,78,This is the best game I have played in a while. I love the open world concept and all the quest lines and the opportunities to collect things.
1787,13,This  game has the same game play as middle earth shadow of war and middle earth shadow. Love it.
1788,11,The development that went into the game is nothing short of incredible. Amazing game.
1789,46,Good Stuff
1790,31,Every time I cast Avada Kedavra. I get an Nerdgasm
1791,19,"Dude, its just fun."
1792,4,Best game I have ever tried period.
1793,30,Defiantly the Harry Potter game everyone has been waiting for. Well worth the price of the adventure.
1794,12,truly a banger. way better than i expected. 10/10 !
1795,10,"I love the versatility, the char. creation could be more but its beautiful graphics wise . The story line is fun and even playing for the open world aspect rocks. So much to do! Im very excited about future updates."
1796,22,good game
1797,37,i love it :P
1798,12,Entirely immersive and is overall easy to play. Hugely accepting of LGBTQ+ which is wonderful to see. I highly recommend it!
1799,7,Best game I have played in years!
1800,21,combat is so fun.game is so fun.i love.
1801,5,this game has awakened a love for harry potter for me and its amazing

1803,23,cool game
1804,3,One of the best games ever made.
1805,5,Is this game good enough to be called a homophobe?...  YES!
1806,28,"Surprisingly great story, great graphics, awesome use of spells and puzzles. Very fun. Absolutely would recommend."
1807,2,My PC is at the minimal requirements and the game still wont work with everything on low. steam wont let me refund it because i was trying to get the game to work for 3 hours and apparently i cant refund it because i played it too long. so long story short i wasted 50 pounds on a game that i cant refund and cant play.
1808,14,good game
1809,6,"The open world is detailed and the combat is fun, I'm enjoying the time I've spent playing so far quite a bit. I was on the fence and took a gamble and it paid off."
1810,12,abracadabra
1811,25,gud gud gamey game
1812,1,needs a performance patch asap. there is some serious stuttering going on.
1813,5,slow at the start but overall I decent game. Maybe wait for a sale
1814,12,"not a harry potter fan but this game is fun, can enter every room to look at staff and touch staff, combat is cool, world is interesting 8/10"

1820,10,good game yes yes
1821,5,I like this game cuz fuck woke people
1822,20,Pretty good open world and flying around on a broom is the funnest way to traverse an open world I've ever seen. I sure hope there's a broom in Tears of the Kingdom...
1823,30,"Open world, lots of secrets and exploring. Castle is near perfect, spells are fun and satisfying. Unexpected combos and 'juggling' was very very awesome. Potterhead or not, this game is amazing. 9/10"
1824,26,EXPLORATION IS AWESOME. combat is easy to master. great game period
1825,3,herbology teacher is fine asf
1826,25,This game is a thorough MASTERPIECE. 11/10I can't stop playing. Thank you Avalanche. I haven't enjoyed a game as much as this one since I first played the Witcher 3 & DLC.
1827,26,"The first single player AAA in a long time where I feel like I actually got my moneys worth. No performance issues on 6700xt & 9700k. Solid game, would recommend."
1828,13,great game!
1829,18,"Excellent game! I have experienced fps drops when running through Hogwarts. Other than that, great game!"
1830,50,"Best graphics ever! Love the lore and the fighting in this game, follows the book more than the movies ever did! Absolutely love the layout of Hogwarts!"
1831,17,Potter Souls? YES.
1832,25,Game. Of. The. Century.
1833,12,Great for those interested in a story or just interested in using magic.
1834,14,AVADA KEDAVRA!
1835,15,"well rounded game, very nice ambiance and gameplay for different types of players"
1836,10,"havada kadabra on them cheeks. Game is sick, tons of fun. Love all the locations and world design. Fantastic."
1837,32,i fucks with it
1838,36,Avada Kedavra!
1839,7,"Any fans of Harry Potter and the universe in which it resides in, Would absolutely have a blast playing this game"
1840,10,"Love the new story and wandering around the castle. I think my favorite touch was the ""Follow the Butterflies"" side quest. Brilliant touch!"
1841,2,"Shit bussin, bussin, respectfully."
1842,15,Wasnt to sure about this game at first. But after watching some game play I gave it a try. I am not disappointed so far. I am enjoying everything so far.
1843,6,"I have failed to find the trans-phobic parts of the game.  The owner of the three broomsticks clearly is a trans-woman and she's a good guy, soooo...."
1844,4,"é bom, só roda meio ruim as vezes."
1845,5,"I just spent 2 hours decorating a room, I am a wizard"
1846,36,"Epic game of Exploration, great combat and a few Lag Spikes"
1847,8,"I was enjoying the game, but after finally fixing some major performance issues with the latest patch I went to the major shop area of the game and most of my map outside of Hogwarts is missing the ground/floor. If I walk over it, I just plummet in an infinite void and no reloading or restarting fixes this. No available solution online from what I can tell other than just starting your entire game over and hoping it doesn't happen again."
1848,13,story lore a bit lame
1849,19,Good game
1850,27,I love this game
1851,5,fucking amazing
1852,11,amazing!@
1853,24,avada kagooodgame
1854,24,You can pet the cats
1855,4,Great game so far. I just love Hogwarts!
1856,19,"I only have one thing to say: ""Avada Kedavra!"""
1857,15,It's Hogwarts. Nothing else needs to be said
1858,12,"Absolutely loving this game! Have had a few minor bugs, but devs have been quick to fix them. Highly recommend if you love Harry Potter!"
1859,27,So far so good
1860,5,Its awsome
1861,19,The Boy- cotters must have done a great job if its number #1 on Steam store
1862,15,insanely fun and immersive game
1863,6,"9/10 Harry potters out of hogwarts. 7.5/10 RPG's out of RPG if you dont like the Potterverse. Combat is fun, story is ok so far - even if the voice acting is so posh its like I'm in a Waitrose"
1864,6,"Beautifully realized world and environments, fun gameplay, unique combat system. A real treat for fans of any level of the Harry Potter series. If you are even a casual HP fan you owe it to yourself to play this game"
1865,64,"Pros:   -Exists in the universe of Harry Potter and tickles the nostalgia bone.   -Combat is really fun, once you get the hang of it!   -Really pretty.   -Decent array of things to do!   Cons:   -Not long enough."
1866,6,"Not a biggest HP fan but this game is all what HP fans could wish for. Huge, lots of things to do and aesthetically 100% legit"
1867,2,This game is amazing I love it its hogwarts the harry potter school.
1868,38,I'm really enjoying this game!
1869,4,The fantasy/exploring aspect is absolutely perfect. Finally a great Harry Potter game.
1870,5,Game seemed great for 2 hours with a few fps drops but nothing major & sure it would be patched..Patch 1 & now doesn't get above 20fps. DONT BUY THIS YET - Wait for patches & optimization because once again another AAA unplayable game. At least cyberpunk ran :8
1871,4,Everything you could want from a Hogwarts game - well worth the money spent!
1872,16,Seems all roads lead to Hogsmeade.
1873,63,I went out of my way to get all the achievements. That should be enough to tell you this game is fucking awesome!10/10 deserves game of the year.
1874,3,Surprisingly inclusive
1875,15,"It took them forever, but def worth the wait"
1876,7,best game
1877,6,good game
1878,13,avada kedavra all day all night
1879,3,fix performance
1880,8,same level as elden ring PEAAAAAAAAK
1881,8,it's quite beautiful and enjoyable to play
1882,16,just let me kill students
1883,6,"pretty good graphics, and good story line"
1884,9,"Those bastards lied to me. Told me this was a ""genocide simulator"". Maybe I haven't gotten that far in, yet..."
1885,8,"Hey, you. You’re finally awake. You were trying to cross the border,right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush, same as us, and thatthief over there."
1886,4,the game is beautiful if you just stand still but it is badly optimized for pc in its current state. best to wait a few months before buying.
1887,7,Way bigger game than I expected!
1888,1,Very good game
1889,23,Great game
1890,24,111/10Recommend - 111%The best your Money can get
1891,8,"I'm not even the biggest Harry Potter fan, but this is an amazingly designed game. One of the best I've played in some time!"
1892,31,"Each house has their own quest! Ravenclaw has the least while Griffondor has the most, Hufflepuff has a secret quest to go to Azkaban while you can enter the chamber of secrets as a Slytherin. PLAY EACH HOUSE!"
1893,2,Pretty good
1894,10,"great game, not too hard so far"
1895,2,"Will update review once PC optimization is drastically improved. Constant stuttering and virtually no GPU usage even after a recent patch. Got past the intro but once you're in Hogwarts, prepare for constant suffering"
1896,35,"Don'¨t know what it it is, but it's addictive. Fun fights, fairly open world, puzzles. Not been binge playing like this since witcher 3, Mass Effect series or Deus Ex. It's cute, but still not completely childish."
1897,10,Amazing!!!
1898,1,"Love it already. But poorly optimized I feel. I have 3060 RTX 16 RAM, and I11 CPU. But I can't play on higher than medium, get very weird stutters. Still get on medium too. I don't know."
1899,2,A very solid RPG. I have played for like 7 hours and it feels like I have so much to explore still. Really well made. Works grade on Deck.
1900,18,Profesor Garlic ♡♡♡
1901,24,Good stuff
1902,27,"You're a wizard Harry! Except, you're the wizard. :)"
1903,13,"""Wizard"" -Mandalorian"
1904,18,"An experience like no other, I never got bored. This game has sucked up so much of my free time and I regret none of it"
1905,4,this games combat is perfect i love it tbh although it only has 26 spells their all so well made i would recommend this to anyone who likes action games or rpgs
1906,20,"incredible game. that's it, that's the review."
1907,5,"its been a while since I enjoyed a game this much , good work"
1908,1,What the fuck is this opti ????? I have an RTX 3070 and a I7 160 go ram and the game is unplayable even in medium settings... This is a real mess better crack the game so denuno don't destroy your experience. Fuck u for the scam
1909,18,Is it worth the money? Yes.  9/10Everything else can be read in other player reviews below.
1910,19,"Fantastic game,one of the best playing games in years. story is interesting,combat is fun."
1911,9,"Call me crazy but so far this game is reminding me of Skyrim! Really is such an impressive game, and has brought me much joy as I play. Thanks to the amazing, passionate developers that managed to pull this off."
1912,8,GOOD GAME
1913,23,Absolutely amazing game
1914,15,"Great game, especially if you like the open world adventure type (think assassins creed style)"
1915,22,Good game.
1916,10,awesome game! lots to do
1917,8,just a banger
1918,12,The game feels amazing. I love exploring and taking in the world. the lore. the overworld and the combat all feel magical. I haven't had a single moment of boredom.
1919,2,"It's a game set in hogwarts and is good, enough said."
1920,25,Very good game!! I loved it
1921,18,"Amazing story, good game play, does need some tweaks to controls and interface"
1922,21,great game. probably best harry potter game yet.
1923,17,I played for 28 hours loaded up my PC to play today and my saves where all gone. It was a great game but now that I have to start all over I am not going to play it any more crazy disappointed even though I manually  saved the game and didn't just rely on auto save.
1924,2,Super Good Game!
1925,19,Sick game
1926,1,"Runs terribly, unplayable for a ton of people, positive reviews are either the few who it runs well with who have good pc's with tons of ram (64) or people who are ultra forgiving and are like ""Oh hai all, games great, bit bad perf but they'll fix it, it's hawwy potta, yayyy, much recommend, bai bai"" which is so bad faith it's unbelievable.      Don't trust me tho, go look in the forums, google hogwarts bad perf, etc you'll find plenttttty.      Eitherway if they did fix the perf and made it run ok on the sys reqs they put it'd be fine.     But it's clear to anyone playing video games on pc for decades this port is terrible, it's so un optimised."
1927,7,Pretty cool!
1928,1,"ok i usually write a review after i finish a game, but i just need to get this out of the way, if you do not have an rtx 40 series don't play this game, absolutely horrendeous optimization in hogwarts, the game gripped me i was having fun, but i just cant play a game that haves 120 fps in one second and drops to 40 in the other then to 60,50,40,100. unnaceptable, do not buy this game until it is fixed"
1929,25,[i] You wouldn’t believe how inconvenient travel was before I invented Floo Powder! [/i]
1930,6,Great game with great graphics
1931,1,esta perrito el juego
1932,38,Seems like all roads lead to Hogsmeade
1933,2,"MOM!!, DADD!! LOOK IM A WIZARDDD WOOOOOO"
1934,21,Great Game! It has an amazing Graphic Design.Its literally Harry Potter with its own Story Line. Amazing!
1935,8,"A++ Easton, Jester, and Ell are all idiots and didn't buy."
1936,11,This game is absolutely amazing!!!
1937,10,love the game i would recommend it to anyone
1938,11,"Awesome game, cant wait to play again and again and AGAIN! lol, i think im obsessed :-S"
1939,26,"the main story is pretty bad. you never get background information about the character you play, choices you make don't have an impact, so you can Avada Kedavra everyone you want, and no one bats an eye. you're also a 5th year student, doing auror work while also combing through the whole map, forbidden forest included. doesn't make much sense to me. fighting is pretty fun though."
1940,0,"This game is amazing, well made, great UI and a fantastic story!"
1941,11,avada kedavra
1942,13,Best harry potter game
1943,25,"11/10 Harry Potter game with surprisingly fun combatside quests are pretty meh, tho"
1944,2,"The game is beautiful, the movements are great and the story line is engaging. Highly recommend."
1945,12,avaaanaaaa kadavraaaaaa
1946,7,It's everything I wanted it to be.Perfect.
1947,8,hopefully they add quitich multiplayer but ive been enjoying it so far
1948,21,The best and most amazing game that was ever created. my life is complete
1949,1,*imperio in professor garlick
1950,3,The Hogwarts castle itself is amazingly detailed. Spent the first few hours just going around and admiring it. Combat is also very cool and the story seems interesting so far.
1951,10,can't stop playing
1952,2,its awsom
1953,5,HARRY POTTER
1954,20,"Amazing game , dont rush to finish the storyline quest , take your time in the game , you will find many interesting stuff"
1955,2,You're a wizard *insert name here*
1956,10,Perfect game!
1957,13,avada kedavra
1958,5,"amazing game. Hogwarts looks just as it is in the movies. all the side quest makes it more fun cause the game runs longer. the game makes you think a little bit to find out how to open door and find other interesting things, deferentially worth it."
1959,37,Every thing I need is in this game
1960,73,GOOD BUT THE LAG MAN
1961,21,good game
1962,5,like skyrim
1963,21,handing out the death curse like its candy
1964,15,"Help! since last update my game physics  broke , the cloaks or robs are stuck to npcs as well any other type of clothing ,its really cutting the imersion."
1965,13,"I'm a lizard, Harry."
1966,22,IT WASN'T JUST A PHASE MOM
1967,3,Witcher 3 for Harry Potter fans!8.5/10Guaranteed GOTY Contender (possibly winner)!
1968,27,game good
1969,1,Stutter stutter stutter. Wish I could enjoy this game to the fullest but it seems that's not possible. How frustrating. Youtube fixes are 50/50 and no amount of setting tampering will help. Seems like a wonderful game none the less.
1970,23,Great game
1971,14,It´s a really great game and it brings back a lot of nostalgie if you watched as a kid harry potter
1972,7,pee pee poo poo cool museum
1973,15,"I have a somewhat mixed opinion of this game. I love the environment they put a lot of detail in just the small things of the world and my favorite part is just running around and exploring. The combat is enjoyable and has a nice flow to it. These are my two favorite things about the game.The reason I can not recommend the game. Is because of the “woke” ideology ruins the main story and characterization in the game. I could easily ignore most of it pretty easily except for the trans character. People have been excusing this as it could be possible in a magical world. But that is the very reason that is so aggravating and infuriating. You have the magic to transform yourself. This character should NOT exist in this world. If they truly wanted to be a “woman” then they could use magic to turn into a “woman”. But instead, we have this character who is pandered to and the whole purpose is to throw this bad line that woe is them because a goblin supported them instead of their classmates. Mind you all their customers stood up for them in the previous scene that they were in. So clearly they are accepted but they still need to say this to a child. The dev also felt to be so progressive a put a ton of female characters in the game. Which in itself I don’t mind in fact there are a few good ones. But because of this, they feel like carbon copies of each other. (Mostly I am thinking of the professors here.) Also the second hand evil character here is a blundering top hat mustached villain, laughably cliché. (Which he has yet to do anything actually evil.. At least with Voldemort you knew that he would happily kill babies.)So instead of making a fun story, the devs attempt to appease a group that not only attempted to boycott the game but continues to insult the devs. Purely because they made this game based off of J K Rowling's world. This “wokeness” is the very reason the movie entertainment is going down the drain. I would hate to see all triple-A games follow in its wake."
1974,7,Haven't had this much fun playing with my wand since I was a teen.10/10
1975,25,amazing game
1976,29,Two times now this game has deleted my save.
1977,4,good game good story.
1978,5,its nice
1979,37,Please more?
1980,3,Just Amazing
1981,8,Great game having lots of fun but the lack of emotions of the characters is dissapointing also the lack of character creation was a let down as well but everything else so far i think the game is good
1982,11,magic wand go brrr
1983,18,Great RPG but if I hear that Suzuki song one more time I'm gonna lose it
1984,4,The game is absolutely beautiful...although I would think with a 3080 I should be able to run ultra settings and ray tracing smoothly. It does not work out that way at times. For the most part an absolute blast!
1985,13,broom flight simulator 2023
1986,7,I get to play with my wand!
1987,23,AVADA KEDAVRA! Its Great :)
1988,12,the boy who lived
1989,19,one of the best games I've ever played
1990,38,"One simple word, AWESOME!"
1991,13,Remember when as a kid you wished you could enrole into Hogwarts as a student? This is as close as it gets.
1992,19,very good game and lives up to expectations. hopefully we get some multiplayer aspect. maybe multiplayer dueling.
1993,8,If you have ever read and enjoyed a Harry Potter book or watched and enjoyed a Harry Potter movie just buy it. I don't know why you are even reading comments.
1994,27,woooow ican't stooooooop 
1995,9,"It's so immersive. I love how it feels like I'm actually walking around at Hogwarts. I would like to feel more bonded to different NPCs so it doesn't feel as lonely, though. But the music is great and the combat is really fun, too."
1996,26,Had low expectations but it was really fun.
1997,7,"Amazing game overall. I think it has a great potential to it - dreaming about it turning into a larger open world, GTA kinda engine, where you'd be able to be in both human and wizards worlds and do missions. Also can't wait until they will ad PVP to it."
1998,25,avada kedavra
1999,18,"Honestly very relaxing, easy to get distracted and explore. Game doesn't punish you too much for dying for failing a mission. I can just sit back and enjoy the game with out feeling stressed."
2000,3,pure awesomeness
2001,38,"Lively world full of detail and secrets, highly customizable outfits, able to cast Unforgivable Curses, can pet every cat you see, and have a pet Thestral! I love this game!"
2002,17,"Well, what can i say? I loved it till i got a bug that permanently dissabled my floo flames. So now im fk'd. What an enormous bummer....."
2003,26,Absolute Banger! Definitely would recommend to anyone on the fence.
2004,8,fun game
2005,6,Best Game all year!
2006,21,Amazing!
2007,9,not a true RPG but looks great and has a lot of potential
2008,10,"Finally able to explore Hogwarts on my own, and it is magical!"
2009,8,so far the game is really good
2010,17,Perfection
2011,23,9/10 why? Where the fk is quidditch :(
2012,11,amazing.
2013,9,"Really good. The story, the wand dueling, the customization. It's a great game."
2014,38,This is the only game where I WANT DLC to delve more into the world. 10/10 would Revelio every 5 steps.
2015,8,shadow wizard money gangwe love casting spells
2016,14,"This game makes me want to make mods for it, more magic spells. MAGIC!!"
2017,22,100% recommend playing this if you are a HP fan. Will love playing with all the houses in the future to see the posibilities.
2018,1,Its hard to get me interested in a game anymore. This game hits home on a few different levels. It combines the rich world of Harry Potter with a Fable 1 like experience and modern day graphics. It's been a blast to play so far.
2019,19,everything i wanted it to be!
2020,19,"Currently, this game has many graphical issues. The water textures are glitching all over the place and now a new glitch appeared where I fall under the map and I can't do anything. I can move and do Revelio but I can't use the map and handbook because it doesn't react. Now I'm stuck there and can't leave. All in all, this game is very good, big for exploration, nice combat system and a really cool story but at this state, it is unplayable."
2021,12,shadow wizard gang we love casting spells
2022,9,very good
2023,40,"90/100 for a ""single player game set at Hogwarts"". By no means perfect but it doesn't leave fans asking for too much (Quidditch DLC please). And for those criticizing the story, please remember this is world is based on books for teenagers."
2024,16,Very good game!
2025,1,"The cats in this game are cute.You can accio a cat closer to you so you can pet it  11/10You can also attacking it with basic attacks so it stumbles and you can chase it to pet it 12/10No matter what you do, you will touch  some pussy"
2026,7,Harrey PottahI always wanted to be able to walk around freely in hogwarts and the wizard world.10/10 would recommend to wizard lizards
2027,12,Legit cat petting simulator. 10/10
2028,15,great ass game with small hiccups with loading and graphics but just truing them down a bit helps a lot(mostly on med with some on high) . hopefully with more updates it will run better at higher graphics.
2029,9,This game is more than I expected...
2030,30,"World is empty and no morality system, but still a solid lukewarm 7.1/10"
2031,0,"Give me back my money. I paid for the game and I can't play it on my RTX 3060. It crashed on shaders loading, but I fixed it with some random solution from youtube but it still crashes at other place. Are you freaking serious? This is AAA game I paid for?"
2032,20,great game
2033,35,"Love this game, its great. A good 8.5/10 game."
2034,9,AWESOME EXPERIENCE
2035,10,Really fun
2036,16,Ur a wizard
2037,33,A dEmIgUiSe!!!!
2038,34,SO AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!  Will be playing this game for years.  Looking forward to DLCs and anything else!!
2039,15,"Graphically, gameplay wise, puzzle difficulty and diversity wise, story wise, audio wise, progression wise, UI interface wise, customization wise, yes, yes it is indeed a good game."
2040,22,you can get lost in this gamemy girlfriend and i want to call in sick and be wizards all weekmost fun we have had in quite some timeit really brings out that childlike wonder
2041,8,"Great game, loads of fun!!!!"
2042,8,Waiting for the Professor Garlick mods. Don't be late to herbology classes.
2043,9,It's a fun adventure. I don't think you necessarily need to be a Harry Potter fan. It's set well before the movies but still has the school setting.
2044,10,"AMAZING - totally worth all of the money. The graphics, the story line, the exploration, the duelling. 100% recommend to everyone."
2045,10,Shadown wizard money gang ( we love casting spells )
2046,12,"Stanley Stammer and the Frame Rate Prisoner Is this a good game ? Yes.. for the most part it is.However, the post launch patch has rendered the game an unplayable stuttering mess for many players. Pre-patch I had good performance, solid FPS and no stuttering (running on an older 6 core i7 with GTX1070). New patch lands and boom this thing stutters worse than Max Headroom on a bad day.Cast a spell? half a second freeze and then a stutter. Turn around? Yep, that's going to cost you 90% of your FPS and a few more st st st stutters.Sort it out Devs.."
2047,37,Hogwarts LAGacy
2048,8,Absolutely amazing all i have to say!!!!!!
2049,13,"Have thoroughly enjoyed this game! There is a good mixture of both chilled game play and fighting when doing quests which I thoroughly enjoy! I genuinely don't think there's a bad word I could say about this game. Highly, highly recommend"
2050,40,Great learning curve. Tansition from introduction to whole open world action is incredibly smooth!
2051,24,ur a wizard harry! avada kedavra!!! 10/10 Puffskeins would recommend.
2052,15,Good game.Annoying bug where a female character sounds like a man.
2053,40,You can pet every cat you see.
2054,42,"Great game, really enjoyable. Rushed all the way until I finished it and can't wait to start it again"
2055,20,good game
2056,15,ver nice
2057,11,"This game is so immersive. Full of things to do.I would recommend it even if you never watched the movie. The game itself is so good, and the story is different from the movie, so there are no spoilers at all.VERY GOOD GAME!"
2058,1,Not necessarily the game I'd have wanted (closer to the look and feel of the books) but a good experience nonethelesess.
2059,21,   I have loved every second of this game. It is exactly what everyone wanted it to be. Be your own witch or wizard. Follow an engaging story. And have a great time with the fighting and game play. 10/10 would absolutely recommend.
2060,12,Very enjoyable. A game that HP fans would enjoy.
2061,7,"The game is great, but i have some problems with stutter and sometimes buggy water effects or even worst like artefacts textures and so on. Otherwise the game is great. I hope they patch it soon and fix this issues."
2062,6,Amazing game but need some improvements when it comes to FPS.
2063,6,Great game the detail on the environment is insane
2064,14,"amazing content, and good story line."
2065,20,Great game!Finally a real worthy Harry Potter world game.
2066,8,so glitchy its a joke even exiting the game takes forever remins me of cyberpunk the mod community will fix it thankgod 
2067,15,"Game is good, buy."
2068,19,perfect!
2069,27,"Excellent game, been enjoying flying about the world of HP and finding all the nuggets of lore tucked away within it. As far as open world games goes this one runs real smooth and has a good magic system for its spells and the characters feel very alive."
2070,12,everything good
2071,3,The frame rate is soooo bad in this game it makes it unplayable
2072,25,Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who deserve it - dobby probably
2073,10,Fun game but not the best
2074,4,A relaxing game. It has some optimization issues but still worth your time.
2075,19,LOVED IT
2076,7,Herbology teacher should be the only reason to buy this game 10/10
2077,4,Idk what it is but this game isnt it for me. This is my second triple AAA game that I bought with elden ring being my first. I didnt find the story intriguing and interesting and the gameplay just feels dead. The NPCs make the same moves and the enemy battles are boring. I will try to finish the game and maybe im going to change my opinion but as of right now i wouldnt recommend it.
2078,13,"everything is amazing so far, graphics, gameplay, story. and  the music is out of this world !"
2079,18,First time I've paid full price for a game in over 3 years. No regrets.
2080,4,no lag but the screen is always spiking
2081,10,Seems like all roads lead to Hogsmead.
2082,16,literally cured my seasonal depression
2083,19,"""You can't possibly imagine how inconvenient travel was before I invented Floo Powder!"""
2084,29,The game has been absolutely stunning so far! The combat is fun and so are all the little challenges around  the map! It has been worth every penny so far!
2085,15,very good
2086,11,"Dis Is Gud Gem Luv Vry Mach, Recumund Hilee"
2087,13,fun game play and good story
2088,4,very good combat system however the story is hard to get into
2089,0,"This game will not run no matter what. As soon as it begins to load gameplay it immediately crashes. It plays smooth on the Steam Deck which is where all my play time has came from since my moderate computer (R7  & 2070S) cant load even on low settings 30fps. I have updated drivers , re-installed, still crashes."
2090,1,Stuttering and bad performance make it unplayable for me right now (RTX 2080s)
2091,4,"One of the best games I've played in the past five years, just needs optimizations to help it run better on my 3080."
2092,41,good game the only thing missing coop play
2093,13,"still buggy, but this game is amazing. It's everything I've wanted from a Harry Potter game since reading the books and watching the movies"
2094,12,"2023 startin off strong, 9/10"
2095,12,You can pet cats
2096,3,first good game in forever
2097,14,avada kedavra
2098,2,Makes my wand hard
2099,7,GOTY Candidate! Awesome RPG for every Potter Head and those that will become one after playing this. Highly recommended!
2100,6,if you are a harry potty fan like most are it is the best game so far i hope they add more content to the game so far i am having so much fun playing it and if you diced to get it i hope you like it just as much as i do.
2101,7,goog game yes i support trans phobia :p
2102,20,very fun game.
2103,15,Fun and very nostalgic. I would say you do need quite a powerful pc for it
2104,50,Story is great still got some graphic issues at lowest settings still way better than launch day lol once the bugs are fixed lets home we get tons of dlc to expand world instead of a new game
2105,8,The magic is very interesting. Just wish the ais brain evolved past the brain stem.
2106,36,despite being a bit laggy on release I love this game very much! good storyline the only thing that I do not like is how it can be wonky dismounting at times but overall yes would recommend this game!!
2107,7,AMAZING! If you love the Harry Potter world you will love this. Money well spent!
2108,6,A childhood dream come true.
2109,17,"Lots of fun, and a lot to do"
2110,32,Very Good Game with a lot of good features and surprises.Expand Modding in this game and it will last :)Definitely a must have.
2111,16,"Literally what we all wanted when we were kids playing ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" on PS1.. Thank you Avalanche!"
2112,11,"Its an amazing game highly recommended even if your not a harry potter fan, if you a overall gamer the fighting and graphics of the game alone is really good."
2113,5,Very good game stupid
2114,6,the game is really glitchy
2115,6,Feb 14 patch broke the game for me. It used to run but now it just crashes after the seizure warning. Just posting this review while I'm waiting for my refund.
2116,9,"So far the game has been fun and immersive. I like the combat mechanics and combat mechanics, though playing on keyboard is more difficult than it would be on a controller. I'm only 10 hours in, so we'll see how it goes."
2117,32,Sometimes it seems like all roads leads to Hogsmeade
2118,9,"You cant do anything to your classmates (or anyone other than poachers), you cant play quiditch, and you cant poach animals."
2119,1,gooooodddddd
2120,23,A magicified Ubisoft formula. Take it or leave it.
2121,15,"Good graphics and immersive world.  The pace is very, very slow.  Very."
2122,13,Finally a game developer delivers a game that feels complete plus some. It's been a very long time since i've enjoyed a game as much as i've enjoyed hogwarts legacy games like this is why i play games
2123,34, 8.5/10 from the Mind 10/10 from the Heart
2124,2,altgough it crashes a few for me (my computer isnt a gaming one so im not sure if its me or the game lol) ive had a lot of fun so far
2125,8,"Super duper fabulous. Great graphics, lots to explore and an interesting story. Props to the developers for releasing such a good game without issue."
2126,12,game good much play
2127,34,Hogwarts Legacy is worth the purchase! Incredible game for all Harry Potter fans.
2128,50,ver nais
2129,13,Highly recommend
2130,3,"Cyberpunk day 1 ran better than this... also please fix the cloth physics, the robe keeps going inside the player or bugs out and parts of it inverts it self Postal III had better coat physics than it. besides the fact that my RTX 2070 super is getting a beat down from this, the game was fun till i reached the school and the farther i progressed the more laggy it became"
2131,20,This game is very entertaining. My favorite part is collecting and caring for magical beasts. I would say my least favorite part is falling thru the map and dying or just getting stuck somewhere on the map. Has only happened twice tho.
2132,21,LOVE IT !
2133,23,"all these negatives are people with shit pcs, who dont know anything about the game, or angry trans. Great game though sooooooo much to discover."
2134,3,"Graphics are as if you are in the game, a great CGI experience for the game."
2135,6,Fun and immersive. Dev team put a lot of effort into the little details and it shows.
2136,3,stuttering issues make the game unplayable. gonna update this review once that fixed
2137,10,Amazing and charming game
2138,65,"[h1]Rating: 4/10[/h1]This game is full of wasted opportunities which would otherwise have made a great game. The developers are relying too much on fillers, like finding over one thousand collectibles or repetitive puzzles and side quests.Loot and items are pretty much pointless. Things like brooms and wands do not make any difference. Got a legendary clothing piece? It will be replaced in a minute by a green level item and inventory management becomes tedious.After a while the game just felt like a chore.Don't be fooled by the amount of hours Steam displays. Getting 100% in-game and 42/45 achievements took about 67 hours, but it was not fun.Now I will have to force myself through it and replay part of the game three more times to get the last achievements.[b][u]Positives:[/u][/b][list][*]Graphics[*]Environment is beautiful[*]Atmosphere[*]Concept[*]Visual clothing options[/list][b][u]Negatives:[/u][/b][list][*]Story is short and forgettable[*]Does not feel like a RPG game at all[*]Lots of bugs, some are progress halting and requiring loading earlier save[*]Stuttery[*]Can't unlock all talents and no re-spec[*]Some achievements require replaying part of the game 3 more times[*]Too much woke and agenda pushing for my taste[*]Crashing and memory leaks[*]Music[*]Denuvo[*]Dialogue choices does not matter[*]Dialogue is cringy[/list][b]Performance:[/b]The performance in general was barely acceptable. Average fps was about 90 to 70-ish but would often drop into the 30's, even with DLSS (which games should not rely on to make up for lack of optimization).Walking around, especially in Hogwarts would stutter a lot.My computer is far above the recommended specs: CPU: Intel i9-9900K 5,2 GHz sustained on all cores -HTGPU: Evga RTX 3080 ti FTW3 Ultra 12GBRAM: Corsair Dominator 32GB (2x16GB) DDR4 16/18/18/36 3200 MHzSSD: Samsung 970 EVO Plus M.2 500GBMonitor: Lenovo Legion Y27gq-20 1440p 165HzIn the end I would just say it is sadly a wasted potential and absolutely not worth full price."
2139,7,Mohammad potter
2140,7,"Laggy and unplayable with i7, 3080 and 32gb ram"
2141,7,BEAUTIFUl
2142,16,This is probably one the best games I have played recently.
2143,5,love everything about it except for a tiny bit of stuttering which should be fixed with couple of patches.
2144,35,"I love everything about this game, from the minor details to the combat; I could go on, but you really need to experience it yourself. Money well spent!"
2145,17,UH DUHHHH AHAHAH
2146,16,great game
2147,18,Beautifully crafted world. Solid combat. Great score. Good story and writing.Looking forward to DLCs.
2148,11,"Amazing game, some glitchiness but thats to be expected from a newly released game. Bought this game in August of 2022 and I am so beyond happy that I did."
2149,2,Best Benedict Cumberbatch dressing simulator I've played this year.  A+
2150,10,"Side quests are fun, game mechanics are fun, optimization is not great though- my 3080 is struggling"
2151,48,"It´s the first RPG game that I play and even though I had a really hard time playing it at the beginning, I'm getting the hang of it. I totally recommend."
2152,8,"Beautiful game, fun combat, interesting characters, interesting story line, and cool gear. Love it."
2153,9,For all the Harry Potter lovers its a great adventure games with a ton of quests magical beast and alot more.Open World many spells and many endings
2154,4,"I just began playing today, but wow! This is fun! I like exploring Hogwarts!"
2155,9,absolute banger
2156,30,FANTASTIC. SPECTACULAR. DECENT. FULL OF MAGIC.
2157,18,"This game is so childish.It captured the essence of Harry POOOter series. Goofy, Adorable, Fun."
2158,17,"Amazing, so much fun and I could just spend all my time running around the castle!"
2159,3,just started playing today. the graphics is mesmerizing and the feeling of casting spells is truly amazing!for a true harry potter fans it is a must have!very very recommended!!10/10 :-)
2160,22,"It will take me about 3 months to take ""REVELIO"" out of my head"
2161,26,Best game ever try it
2162,21,"Good game; starts a lot better than it ends. It ticks all the boxes, but most of the characters and story just aren't that interesting."
2163,7,"The beginning is a bit slow but after that, it's a fantastic game. Exploring a fully fleshed out Hogwarts and world really gave me some childhood nostalgia. The combat is rather fun as well."
2164,25,amazing game
2165,3,It's a good game BUTTHE DUELS ARE UNFAIRTHEY ALWAYS HAVE AN ADVANTAGEI'M PLAYING AGAINST SMURFSAND MY TEAMMATE IS BOOSTEDALWAYS TROLLINGEITHER BAITING ME OR AFKCAN'T WINPLEASE FIX MATCHMAKING
2166,35,just needs load outs for transmogrify  gear
2167,13,i loved it i played for 20 hours before i opened it to find all my characters gone if they tested their game and did their job this would've been fixed
2168,17,"love this game, looks great, plays great, no performance issues, the world is much bigger than i expected, and much more content than expected."

2179,18,"A Time Turner, lost many hours"
2180,2,"I was never super into Harry Potter, but I did like the magic and stuff. However when I first saw Fantastic Beast and where to find them I was a little more hooked. The gameplay is amazing and I love open world and able to custom your own wizard/witch."
2181,19,"Waited for this type/universe gamer for years. I really like it so far.It has some annoying things, i.e. loading time between locations.But overall great experience."

2187,1,The game is awesome!
2188,10,"Awesome story, fun combat, lots of content"
2189,7,It's good
2190,13,Would be a great game if it ever would actually load up instead of just black screening at load up every time
2191,11,"this game is the game for all harry potter fans needed, and even if you haven't read or seen any of the books or movies you still enjoy the game."
2192,55,Amazing game!
2193,44,phenomenal game with a great story and voice acting
2194,6,Takes a minute to get used to. I think I had played about 5 hours before really starting to love it.
2195,12,"[b]SHORT[/b]I guess what i don't like the most is that i cant live up my DARK BROODY MYSTERIOUS DARK WIZARD arcand game is too bright[b]LONG[/b]I've been HP fan since I was 6, basically grew on these movies and still rewatch them quite often. I'm 23 now. And of course I really wanted to play this game, since there never was any game at this quality level in the HP universe. However, with my absolute open mind towards this experience, it left me with mixed feelings. [b] ATMOSPHERE [/b]The dev team did a great amount of work rebuilding and redesigning the Hogwarts so it will be interesting to explore and player won't get tired of the same brick n stones - I get that, however throughout my journey I couldn't help but feel that overall this doesn't feel like Hogwarts. The music, some parts of Hogwarts, overall vibe, the whole ancient magic arc and new architecture just seem alien to me. [b] GAMEPLAY [/b]Looting system is annoying, nothing feels achieved. I skip the chests sometimes because I just don't feel the motivation to open them - most of the gear looks boringly designed and I know i will have to clear up the space for it anyway. There's very little you can interact with in the game. There's repetitive puzzles here n there, another cute looking hidden room, but at the end of it just a box with another pair of gloves or glasses. Everything feels repetitive and loses it's charm after 10 hours of the game. [b] CONSEQUENCES [/b]In Hogwarts Legacy it doesn't matter if you are killing with Avada or torturing with Crucio. All your choices have no consequences in the game - no matter which house you gonna choose, or what you gonna say, or if you gonna kill. I guess it's OK for some people who haven't been playing in games where it matters, but idk, I feel like once you've tried it it's really hard to come back. Maybe I made a mistake playing Red Dead Redemption prior New Year - if we talk about best open world game I just come back to this one. Even tho it was not RPG. Or at least Witcher, to that matter - same genre but what it has that Hogwarts legacy doesn't is an insane story and impressive characters, much deeper gameplay and overall bigger amount of details. [b] CONCLUSION [/b]This Hogwarts doesn't feel like Hogwarts to me. During my first two hours of the game I realised that best to see it as alternative Wizarding World. It's engineered to be too cute and simple just to be interesting to the most casual players. But it's impossible to please everyone. I will just keep to the movies."
2196,7,"Bro, this game is so good, i can't believe it!"
2197,24,Elden ring v2
2198,6,"a polished game with a fun spell system, good combat and ZERO FUCKING BUGS FOR ONCE, 7/10 would recommend"
2199,26,One of the best games overall i have ever played!!

2201,12,BORING ASS GAME FOR SOYBOY NERDS
2202,5,"Its fun! Easy to get into and if you ever wanted to run around Hogwarts casting spells, this is the game for you!"
2203,2,"HOGWARTS STUTTERY Once again a terrible PC launch. The game play itself seems decent, problem is it runs like absolute shite. 3080ti-3900x can't even run the game in 1440p without constant stutters. It's another release broken fix it later kinda deal. Too think it runs and looks better on a £500 console. Why did I pay £1000 for a graphic card that advertised ray tracing when I can't even run ray tracing. Can't believe yucky consoles get better treatment than PC players."
2204,11,"I know absolutely nothing about harry potter, but I have been playing for 18 hours now. Its good."
2205,2,"Beautifully crafted world with attention to detail, the art direction is spot on, and I especially like the soundtrack. However, I can't recommend the game due to the poor optimization and stutters. It's frustrating to buy new hardware to play games like this while developers release these games in such unoptimized state. When the optimization improves, I will change the rating to positive."
2206,45,"This game is absolutely fantastic. The graphics, the characters, the story, all superb! Chefs kiss🤌"
2207,34,Rare WB games massive W

2211,27,Like being there yourself. :)
2212,6,"amazing game,capturing the feel of its worlds perfectly, absolutely 100% recommended !"
2213,15,Decent for the expectations the game had
2214,15,From the gentle art of cat caressing to the thrilling sport of gobstone thievery: uncovering the duality of man. Game of the year. RTX off.

2221,2,"RTX 2070 Super hereVery bad performance not even at bare minimum acceptable level. Did every ""guide"" out there on YT and Reddit, nothing working. We don't have to go through all of that in the first place. No updates from devs nor any communication regarding these issues. Literally unplayable."
2222,21,"Shockingly bad performance, don't buy until they actually optimise it for PC"

2229,34,10/10 im gonna prob play it again
2230,42,One of the best gaming experiences I've had even though it felt rather short.
2231,12,Play it!
2232,6,ITS NICE
2233,77,An amazing game. If this was an mmorpg it would take the gaming industry to another level
2234,14,good game
2235,33,yer a wizard harry
2236,50,Love it <3
2237,9,love it enough said  i recommend it to harry potter fans it very immersive in my opinion. i'm not very far in since I've just been going full explorer mode
2238,14,I already commited several war crimes :D
2239,5,Living a wish !!!
2240,34,Fantastic game! Definitely living up to my expectations.
2241,47,My only complaint is just that I want more of everything.  It's amazing.
2242,12,"apparently, a Muggle high-end PC isn't enough to run this game. Love the game in terms of story, exploration, and magic but I cannot recommend because it is extremely unstable.. consistent frame drop issue takes away all the fun. I hope the wizards and witches at Avalanche fix this damn thing!"
2243,20,"Finally got my letter. Peace out, muggles."
2244,25,one of the better games ive played in along time
2245,19,fun until you realize you cant actually be evil until late game
2246,11,Almost like a Jedi ;P
2247,3,hehe harry poter
2248,8,A very well-made open world role-playing game!
2249,11,Amazing. Just amazing.
2250,10,Its good.
2251,3,"Good gameplay and an awesome recreation of the ""Harry Potter"" world."
2252,8,Its a good time if your into it
2253,36,"Fun game, lots to explore. Voice options limited to 1 male 1 female with pitch variation, changing pitch makes character sound robotic so please don't."
2254,38,"really enjoying this RPG. the gameplay is almost seamless, though the cut scenes do run a bit long.I want my broomstick, darn it!"
2255,15,Finally a game that's actually playable on release and heaps of fun. 10/10.
2256,13,"I did enjoy the game when it didn't crash, but it does crash quite a lot and I have tried various 'fixes' to no avail.Edit: Game runs excellent until it doesn't."
2257,6,I'm a wizard Harry
2258,34,Windgardium reviewstarWouldwizardagain/20worth getting even if your not a huge fan of the franchise
2259,3,Awesome game very fun
2260,16,broom go vroom
2261,9,Hogsmeade is my home.
2262,7,Don't do single player game that much but this one is got me hooked.
2263,45,Was fun being a wizard and stuff. The games main story being done in 3 hours is not fun. Other than that I padi 70$ for an achievement hunting game cause thats the only end game. even the O.W.L.S werent the end game. Either wait for dlc and price drop or wait for the modding community to make this THEIR game.
2264,22,AVADA KEDAVRA
2265,18,So much and lots to do
2266,10,It is a super pretty game so much to do I love it
2267,21,Just amazing!
2268,19,Awesome! That is all
2269,8,Good fun
2270,40,NOICE. Elden Ring but less scary
2271,21,beautiful
2272,29,"Nostalgia, Be the Wizard you have always wanted to be :D"
2273,8,A wonderful game
2274,36,"Finished this masterpiece within 3 days..amazing story line,graphics and the obv the magicforgot about the real world ;)10/10 worth a try"
2275,7,The game constantly shuts down on its own. I have to restart the computer every time that it happens just to get the game to start up again. Really annoying.
2276,1,DIAGONILLY
2277,42,"its what they call woke, so the controversy around it is all bs, but besides that its a really good game and i would recommend it all sides of the political sides. lol seriously its  a really good game."
2278,2,worth the wait
2279,13,I'm a wizard Harry!
2280,14,fucking love this game
2281,18,Love the game but it does have some frame rate issues 9/10
2282,16,"This is game is amazing, does get a little repetitive but they are supposed to be coming out with multiplayer later. It is exactly what you are looking for if you want an RPG with magic and being to explore  Hogwarts and around. Highly would recommend."
2283,40,Just absolutly love this game
2284,16,"Games great fun, not a huge Potter fan but watched the trailers and I thought I would give it a try. Im glad i did so much fun exploring and looking for hidden chest and solving puzzles."
2285,27,"If you like the Harry Potterverse/Wizarding World then this game is a MUST-BUY. You can tell the development team put their heart and soul into making this an authentic, immersive game with secrets and details to find around every corner. Congrats, Avalanche!"
2286,8,"other than the game being very very very badly optimized, pretty fun"
2287,4,fun game. i like to pet the cats :)
2288,2,Very nice. Bit laggy for me but great gameplay.
2289,4,ive waited so long for this game. it did not disapoint!
2290,9,So much fun! There is so much to do and the graphics are amazing!!!
2291,4,The game is a fun chance to explore the Hogwarts and Hogsmeade area. The school is massive and exploring alone in the game makes it worth a look if not a purchase.
2292,3,awesome and fun
2293,4,Actually fun game.Had to refund on steam and buy on Epic since shaders didnt load for god knows what reason.But after that I got really into it and had lots of fun :)9/10 Game Combat gets a bit boring after main story
2294,22,it's just perfect
2295,5,"Alright, SO FAR (because I don't want to forget anything as I continue playing) the characters voice sounds like she's talking through a tin can. It sounds all weird and modulated, like the developer didn't take any time to even try to make it sound like... well, a person. Which is especially annoying, because every interaction you have for a quest has character dialogue. Next, what is up with the sleeping on the ground to wait animation? Seriously, you went through the whole process to create the house dorms for all four houses and I cant even sleep in my own bed? Absurd. I'm separating this one into its own paragraph, because it needs to stand out. Why are the cosmetic options tied to specific items? They should be tied to the item slot, not a specific item to overwrite. Upgrading gear is a tedious burden because each time I have to go into the items and overwrite them to have my character continue to look the way I have them dressed.Finally, the controls for the broomsticks suck. rather than putting all of the movement on the left stick and looking with the right stick, they split movement between the two and only allow looking left and right... with the right stick. So one stick controls both vertical movement and looking left and right. Tell me you've never developed a video game, without TELLING me you've never developed a video game. Smooth brain mechanics."
2296,19,Can't Avada Kedavra the cats in this game but you can rocket launch them across the room. 10/10 would yeet cats again
2297,6,#NAME?
2298,19,AMAZING GAME
2299,75,"Game of the year, I couldnt have asked for more. It was well worth the life-long wait, and i eagerly look forward to the DLC!"
2300,7,still dragon ridinstill maiden banginthis mutha fkn wizard got in to crack slangin
2301,5,GOY amazing production it's a cinematic master piece everywhere you look
2302,1,"12600K 4070tiUnplayable.The introduction runs perfectly fine, but once in Hogwarts, it is constantly stuttering and freezing.It looks to be an awesome and beautiful game though, so I hope they'll fix it soon enough."
2303,20,"Absolutely amazing game!!! Sooooooo worth the wait. Beautiful sceneries, fun quests and so much to explore. You can play for hours and it feels like barely any time has passed. Highly recommend!"
2304,15,"very fun, mostly for Harry Potter fans. dialogue a bit cringe, but still a lot of fun stuff to do"
2305,9,"Very good, nice even good i would say"
2306,3,why is it so addictive
2307,24,Game of the year for sure. If this wont get it imma eat my broom. I want more give me all the dlc's yall can make!
2308,2,it is fun
2309,2,I am getting into pc gaming for the first time and let me tell you I LOVE THIS GAME!!!
2310,26,very good game 10/10
2311,3,Recommended period.
2312,8,Good Game
2313,9,good game
2314,33,"Incredible and breathtaking experience. Wish this game had more content, which it already has more than enough of, just can't get enough of the HP universe!"
2315,8,This game has a lot of frame rate issue similar to Gotham Knight during the first month of game before the patches. But if they're able to resolve those issues then this is a very fun game.
2316,12,"Wonderful game and finally being able to travel around the whole map, it's the best part."
2317,30,Murder is cool
2318,41,AVADA KEDAVRA!
2319,1,"geniunly runs like shit, fast travel takes like 5 minutes and alot of dialouge gets skipped, it freezes quite alot and its just genuinely unplayable."
2320,16,better than expected just runs like poop now and then
2321,0,best game i played in a while
2322,2,very good garphicks and story 10/10
2323,7,Great fun.
2324,26,"One of the better single-player games I've played and ""finished"""
2325,24,Livin' out my dream as a witch at hogwarts. What could be better than that? Also I can pet the cats 10/10

2327,9,"9 out of 10 EBI: Let me use ""Crucio"" on a child also quidditch dlc"
2328,4,just get it! you wont regret!
2329,32,"Game is BROKEN Don't buy until they fix it. Works fine till you get like 12 hours in or at Hogwarts then we take a trip back to PlayStation 1 land! Where characters look all blocky and the textures pop in and out, MOSTLY out. FIX IT or give me my money back and I'll change my review.Enjoy my $110 WB Games!!!!"
2330,9,Funny magic game go brr
2331,11,Cyberpunk on PS1 runs better than this.
2332,24,Amazing.... but uhm when can I marry Sebastian? Or do I need a love potion?
2333,35,This game is incredible it runs very well on my rtx 2060 in 1440p medium settings and i have enjoyed almost 70% of content without any complaints.It is a love letter to harry potter fans such as myself.
2334,1,very good
2335,25,"Game is amazing if you buy it, you wont regret it!"
2336,6,davai davai
2337,15,a very good game
2338,16,"Guys developers, THANK YOU SO MUCH for your efforts! Phenomenal work! I've been waiting for this game all my conscious life and it FULLY met my expectations, and even more! I love you!"
2339,18,tbh kinda mid game. 6/10edit: with the 14th of feb performance patch its gone from mid to actually unplayable across all settings (it usually ran on high to high-medium). unacceptable. i hope steam issues a late refund
2340,5,verry good
2341,2,"Seems like a fun game if it was playable, freezes constantly on my 3070. I'd personally hold off purchasing until they fix it. Seems like a poor console port for PC"
2342,33,"Awesome game, Love being able to cast crucio on dark wizards for poaching magical beast. World is beautiful could use a little fine tuning on the characters voice it sometimes sounds artificial and sounds like a echo."
2343,10,need to be game of the year its to good and awesome
2344,20,"Great game, really keeps you interested"
2345,18,If you are a Harry Potter fan and haven't played this game then you are not a Harry Potter fan.
2346,2,"Super low fps, didn't like fighting mechanics"
2347,7,Very nice
2348,10,it's almost everything I imagined! Great job!
2349,17,"The game is great, but I would wait for some serious updates before buying it.Firstly, if you need help finding the place to buy combat seeds, it's north of Hogsmeade. The marker for the shop is conveniently blocked when you open the map. Scroll up a bit and you should find it. I had to look this up because shops don't appear until you zoom in on a town, and the default zoom has the marker blocked by the ""world map"" and ""Hogwarts map"" tabs at the top of the screen. Also, if you can't find the room of requirement on the hogwarts map, select the ""Secret rooms"" tab and it will show up. Not sure why it doesn't just show the floo. My second issue is it does a terrible job of explaining things. The best example of this is the lock picking mini-game that should never have existed, and I wish you could turn off. You spin the wheels until the green and orange cogs start turning, then hold the position until the lock opens. Nowhere is this explained. It gives you the spell, throws you in the mini-game, then says ""spin the wheels to open the lock"" and that's it. I had to look it up since you can't exit the mini-game and there are no other indicators of what to do.Last but not least, the combat feels bad. It's not so bad when you have three of four enemies, but any more than that and you'll be spending more time dodging then casting. Not parrying by the way. The number of times a prompt hasn't shown and I lost half my health is absurd. It also wouldn't be so bad if spell switching wasn't so annoying. I'm playing on controller, so I have to hold RT and push a direction on the D-pad to change spells. Each direction has four spells slotted, and you swap between them. The problem is, RT is also basic cast AND held to spell cast. There have been COUNTLESS times when I'm try to change spells and accidentally cast something or vice versa. Then your stuck standing there staring at an enemy with a colored shield, who can't take damage until hit with a specific spell, while his friend comes in from off screen to chunk you for half your health bar. Because you know... missing prompts. Again, overall the game is fun, but I can't really recommend it since I've had situations where I've just had to put the game down in frustration and walk away due to stupid nonsense."
2350,25,this was the Fable remake/sequel that we've been waiting years for. it just happens to take place in the HP universe!
2351,12,The scenery and graphics are beautiful! And I really appreciate the fact that I can equip the best gear for battles but change the appearance to other pieces of clothing so I can keep both aesthetic and functionality with my character!
2352,2,its good
2353,4,The game is fun but not too difficult at the same time
2354,32,"Well worth my money!! Such a great way to bring the Wizarding World universe into a video game, I can't stop playing"
2355,16,"A mid tier game that is over-hyped because its related to Harry Potter, boring plot that goes nowhere.Yo can't even interact with NPCs."
2356,28,I cannot stop.
2357,12,shartius maximus
2358,17,"The game is cool for the first 5 hours but quickly becomes a repetitive mess. A lot of the characters look and talk the same way and outside of Hogwarts, the game doesn't have much to offer. There isn't enough diversity in the characters, combat, quests, or open world for me to continue to play this without it feeling like a chore."
2359,11,fun easy to learn how to play.
2360,15,Amazing AF
2361,14,"/this game is perfection, 10/10 you should get it"
2362,16,The game is everything you would ever what in a Hogwarts game. It is Epic
2363,4,you're a wizard harry
2364,3,"I have to say, I'm really disappointed with the optimization of this game. I'm playing it on my RTX3070 laptop with 16GB RAM and even though I'm only running it on 2k medium graphics without ray tracing, the game frequently experiences sudden drops in frame rate, especially during cut scenes or conversations. No matter what settings I adjust, the frame rate just doesn't improve, and I often have to restart the game to make it playable again. It's frustrating because I know the game has so much potential to be immersive, but these optimization issues just keep dragging me out of the experience. It's not just me either; I've seen a lot of criticism about this problem online. At this point, I can't even focus on playing. I really hope the devs can address this soon with a patch or update. If they do, I'll happily change my comment to reflect the improvements."
2365,16,"Terrible performances on a setup well above the recommended. Tried every ""fixes"" available online. First it was heavy stutter and frame drops but after 25 hours the game started crashing every 30 minutes."
2366,10,"The latest update has destroyed the game for me. I can't run it more than 30 secs without a crash. It was fine, if a bit stuttering, before. Now the game is literally unplayable. For reference, I have 12900k + 3080"
2367,6,"Imagination: Adava Kedavra, Adava Kedavra, Adava Kedavra, Adava Kedavra, Adava Kedavra, Adava KedavraReality: Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio, Revelio10/10 would Revelio again"
2368,48,"I have been a big Harry Potter fan for a long time, and this game exceeded my expectations. I can happily recommend getting this game."
2369,59,I want to cultivate my seeds in Professor Garlick.
2370,3,"Multiple performance issues, buggy game features."
2371,9,it's a good game with beautiful scenery and so far a good story. I have mostly done side quests and explore the map so far
2372,2,"Do not buy this game if you care about graphics, runs poorly with a 4090 and a 13900k at 4k and doesnt even look that great"
2373,24,Great Game
2374,18,GRYFFINDOR WINS THE HOUSE CUP!
2375,22,A great singleplayer game that brings magic and hogwarts to the player

2378,3,Yes-yes. Good
2379,13,"Visually appealing, lots of things to occupy your time outside of rushing through the story. I enjoy that your wand is purely cosmetic."
2380,37,very boring couldn't play more than a couple hours.
2381,13,DID YOU PUT YER NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIRE!?
2382,38,"i recommend, because its a good game, great story and fantastic combat."
2383,33,One of the best games I've ever experienced. A must play for any fan of the franchise.
2384,26,This game is amazing!
2385,21,Gud game 10/10
2386,11,Good Graphics and story line.
2387,0,"I knew my PC specs are on the lower end and wanted to test the game for myself. Unfortunately in the first 70 minutes of gameplay I felt like there was about 50 minutes of cutscenes (not actually playable content.) And at the start of those cutscenes the fps drop was significant.I returned the game in the 2 hour play period on steam, because it didnt really felt I played those 2 hour, but was just watching not very interesting movie about unknown wizard."
2388,16,Great game and I highly recommend it to anyone that's a fan of HP and RPG's.
2389,35,Poppy Sweeting supremacy
2390,23,there is still a little more optimization in this game my gpu 2060 is still a little laggy
2391,19,best game
2392,3,i'm petting every cat i see
2393,8,"Great game, few teeny tiny bugs with the npcs, but its nothing a quick load cant fix. Would definitely recommend if you got a pc that can run it without lag."
2394,4,"Runs like cr@p, my PC is well above recommended system requirements, running settings lower than the games benchmark recommends doesn't fix it. Unfortunately the patch released hasn't helped at all. I was so excited for this game but I couldn't possibly review it's content as it's been unplayable for me. The only thing I can say is the character creation was desperately lacking. Purchase at your own risk."
2395,10,hahaharrypotter

2412,1,"This game is absolutely beautiful. I cannot get over how amazing the graphics are, how beautiful and smooth the gameplay is..... And we get to see so much more detail of this world we've all come to love. I see myself putting a lot of hours into this game."
2413,11,yes yes yes
2414,14,"Sadly not transphobic, but still good."
2415,8,Very good game! Even without knowing much about Harry Potter one can still enjoy this game.

2417,3,Transphobia
2418,14,"Definitely fun, lots to explore or if you just want a new Hogwarts story that's fantastic as well."

2431,23,"This game is fantastic, ignore all the trolls and haters. Immersive, fun, and rich with all things Harry Potter/Hogwarts. A must play for fans of the series."
2432,4,"Game is good, but until the performance issues are fixed, I can't recommend it."
2433,37,Repetitive and your choices make no difference to the outcome of anything. It doesn't feel like an open world RPG at all.
2434,7,the nostalgic places and landmarks in this game are priceless (castle is beautiful). Combat is actually entertaining and everybody having voices is great (i hate reading dialog). this is literally everything i could ask for in a hogwarts game.
2435,34,Game of the year
2436,8,Please let me have sex with Professor Garlick.
2437,6,Good single player game in a long time that offers everything right at launch. Really shows the work and dedication these devs did. Don't get games like this anymore!

2453,12,"runs like shit on my pc, but I'm still having fun. Hopefully they do something about that."
2454,43,"Little glitches and bugs here and there but overall a good game, fully immersed in the experience of being a dark arts witch"
2455,9,"Great game, not perfect, terribly optimised.Yer a Lizzard Barry!"
2456,13,"I've found the game very clunky, things like being forced to walk next to NPC at snail speed for instance is not entertaining.  The menu and general UI is terrible, feels like an after thought.Twice I had to load old saves as I randomly got stuck in objects.I didn't really find the game fun, but once you pay for it, you continue in the hope that it improves, it doesn't."
2457,29,Fun game
2458,36,Endless fun thus far!
2459,2,"incredible game , poor optimization tho needs to be fixed and the game would be perfect"
2460,21,Not worth the time invested. Very repetitive missions and puzzles. Decisions make no difference what so ever.Only like 5 different enemy types. Main story missions bland and too short for a AAA title. Only buy if you are a massive HP fan.
2461,3,"great game, dont fall into the boycott"
2462,38,best harry potter game and best game of Ive played in years
2463,16,"I can't decide if the thing I love most about this game are the visuals or music, both are 10/10This game is absolutely fantastic"
2464,7,"what da hell is going on with performance? it goes worse and worse! where and when did you loose DLSS? it's just not anymore an option suddenly! today i simply can't play because of performance and crashes on boot.you loose it, seriously. the game is interesting (even though a lot of narrative choices look weirdly placed while trying to balance between own story and Potter's books), a lot of activities, beautiful world. But then UI could be much better (especially the map UX).Still performance is a killer of this game for sure."

2472,33,"wozrd gam, v gud -bingus"

2475,26,great game
2476,12,is good make me feel magical and makes depression a bit less severe
2477,10,"good game, big world but doesnt feel empty when exploring"
2478,6,"Surprisingly good, would recommend! Ray tracing kills performance, so turn it off xD"
2479,32,"Amazing game, exploring the castle grounds is a dream come true and the world is so alive..."
2480,7,Quite literally the greatest game I have ever played in my life. 10/10 you wont be disappointed.
2481,33,great game
2482,5,best game ever!
2483,2,Fantastic game!
2484,28,Very Niiiiiiiiice!
2485,20,good game
2486,5,"You're a wizard, what more is there to say?"
2487,9,Was well worth the wait!
2488,15,"Needs patch regarding optimization. Runs slow even on beefy setups. After patch, figure all will be good. Love this game."
2489,30,a vara qué raba
2490,29,"Early glitches made the experience a little more puzzling. However, the overall gaming experience has been captivating and entertaining; two of the most important attributes in my opinion. I am addicted!"
2491,2,YOUR A WIZARD HARRY
2492,13,Graphics 10/10
2493,13,"All you want if like me you wanted to be a wizard/witch since you saw the first movie!Amazing gameplay, super imersive and of course could it get any cosier than Hogsmead?"
2494,30,"awesome game, just as you expected!"
2495,63,"8.5/10, 1 point off for no Quidditch. Really solid game. Does need DLC quests. It is  quite stale after completing main story line."
2496,19,Top 3 best games ive played
2497,46,เป็นเกมที่สนุก และเต็มอิ่มมาก ถึงแม้ว่า Performance จะทำออกมาไม่ดีเท่าไร ขนาดเครื่องแรงยัง กระตุก แต่ก็ถือว่า คุ้มค่า เอาไปเลย 9/10
2498,6,Beautiful
2499,23,what a game <3
2500,25,"Brilliant game, beautiful world. The first time a Harry Potter game has given me a sense of awe and the joy of exploration."
2501,2,Awesome gem
2502,4,"fun, immersive"
2503,5,"I've never gotten into RPG games. I couldn't even get into Skyrim, but this game has really sucked me in like no other..... I'm so excited to keep playing and i cant stop. Also, the map is huge and Hogwarts castle is so hard to navigate... I love it."
2504,26,"well designed game  massive map, loads of missions, types of missions to fit different play styles."
2505,17,"Awsome game.  Puts you in the Harry potter world for you to explore, good story.Only downside is the starting up the game as it has to load the shaders, and the loading of certain area while exploring the castle.  Besides that Highly recommend."
2506,20,"just awesome, only improvement would be Co-op/ MMORPG using a  similar format. Lets hope this was a testing ground for that to actually happen eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
2507,19,Some minor wokeness but all in all good stuff.
2508,4,Huge performance issues. Framedrops and freezing
2509,3,ist cool
2510,8,"Fantastic Game! If you enjoy Harry Potter or just a quality RPG, this game is for you! I still find it funny people are boycotting this game. Its fun and the world is as engaging as can be. I regret not buying it sooner. Two thumbs up!"
2511,30,"This game is amazing and is incredibly immersive, cant recommend enough!"
2512,53,the best game
2513,24,"за 40ч игру даже не прошёл и могу сказать, что это..просто..ахуенно.[i]оптимизация говнище конечно, но это должны пофиксить[/i]"
2514,4,fps goes kinda poo poo but its great
2515,2,Optimization is meh rest of the game is good.
2516,9,the best
2517,9,good story fun game play and alot of quests to do best game
2518,5,im having just as much fun with this game as i did skyrim
2519,17,Great game.
2520,21,its bussin no cap
2521,17,Revelio!
2522,2,"Great detailing, amazing graphics. Need to optimise the game to use less RAM"
2523,16,"Great game in general, especially if like harry potter, so many things to do in this game 9/10."
2524,2,"Stop the pc nonsense!Why the heck does a kind female looking bartender speak like a stupidass trans motherf**ker?Shouldn't I have the freedom to choose whether being imposed with those minority stuff?Centuries ago trans already in England!? That's so very modern.There are always better ways to do such thing, but you chose the most disappointing and offending way, since the majority preferences are not considered, as there's no choices for us players but to take it. (And the skipping is different at that part, think someone else noticed that as well.)Minority is minority for a reason, it's not mainstream! People all have their freedom, but why not the minor stay accordingly like their portion in society? why do I need to see them everywhere?Tired.thumbs down, as a tainted painting it is."
2525,5,Cute animals and lots of fun doing stuff10/10
2526,8,Almost everything you could want out of a Hogwarts-centered RPG. It just feels magical and wonderful.
2527,8,Surprisingly good combat mechanics and world building. Unfortunately the game runs like complete ass but you can turn off RT if you need the performance boost.
2528,13,"very good, addicting"
2529,11,Really enjoying this game!
2530,26,"Turn the lights down kick back on the couch, playing it yourself or watching someone else play, it's an amazing experience."
2531,34,Very enjoyable game.
2532,7,you are not a transphobe if you play the wizard game.also professor fig says trans rights
2533,21,I like it.
2534,39,really interesting content along side a brilliantly thought out storyline
2535,9,"Its a beautiful well finished game, very much recommended! Don't let ""WOKE""(lol) control you, you love harry potter, you'll love this!"
2536,14,JK would be proud!!
2537,12,rly good gdme
2538,19,"Honestly only posting to get steam to fk off asking me if I liked the game.FFS If I have 30+ hours played it's obviously good enough to keep ""my"" time.  Which means it is probably good enough for everybody else.Now leave me alone steam jesus christ."
2539,2,"Its nice, but there is so much tiny mistakes or tiny things that can be done better. The ambientation and music are great, but you cannot talk with anyone, only with people pertinent to the quest, the secrets are easy and you have one spell to find them, so when you enter a room you throw revelio and there is that.Performance : 0"
2540,4,fun game... but why cant I pause during cut scenes?
2541,23,Great game. The most single player fun I've had since Skyrim came out
2542,11,"Lacks quality of life features.Lacks immersion - you can't sit, can't sleep, can't join the main hall dining table, don't have a schedule to keep up with.Puzzles are basically 'cast left-click three times'.Forces you to fulfill side quests and interact with characters you don't want to.Hogwarts itself is tiny.You can't have meaningful conversations with npcs.You can't have friends and spend time with them.You can't pet owls you encounter.You can kill. Nobody ever mentions this. As if it is normal for a 15-16 year old to routinely go hunt dark wizards.There are no house points on display, even if a professor says 'points to house', nothing changes.And last but not least - why does every professor treat the protagonist as a second coming of Merlin himself? They are almost licking the protag's boots."
2543,25,One of the most amazing games to date! And to think 'those' wanted to boycott... that sure blew up in their face /Laugh! Love you JK Rowling and all you stand for and have given us in your amazing stories through the years <3
2544,1,IS GOOD!
2545,7,Wand goes Brrrrrrrr
2546,21,10/10 points for Slytherin
2547,21,Unique and very nostalgic.
2548,12,"great game, too bad no online co-op features"
2549,16,Avadagedavcasnrar
2550,8,Game crashes if try to use the floo flames to travel after like 10 minutes of playing.
2551,22,I love being a wizard and i love this game (real not fake)
2552,33,ITS COOL
2553,29,it's hella good
2554,10,Really great game.Performance sucks ass though (download Ascendio mod to fix this)
2555,13,"Amazing, enough said."
2556,16,"Commit Warcrime, Drink tea,Tis a Wizards life for me."
2557,31,"I can confidently say that, Yes bro I can leviosa"
2558,31,Better then what i expected
2559,9,Excellent game
2560,11,my childhood right there
2561,8,Ignore the people who say buying a game make you a storm trooper lover if you know what I mean ;)
2562,11,"3rd person usually isn't my thing but this is lit. Combat easy to get to grips with, good story line. Kicks off with a bang!"
2563,13,"Richtig gut, grosse, frei begehbahre offene Welt. Ist schon richtig gut und hat Potential für gute DLC`S"
2564,14,Skyrim but with Hogwarts
2565,3,Sense of wonder when exploring
2566,24,best game ever
2567,8,Everything a HP fan ever wanted in a game. Extremely open world and the attention to detail is incredible. Only complaint is that the challenges are a bit easy and finding chests is also a little too easy.
2568,3,"Absolutely amazing game, Great representation."
2569,3,finally living my dream
2570,8,Very good
2571,37,A  Good game! a few bugs and stutters here and there but overall a solid 8/10
2572,20,"10/10, would avada kedavra again"
2573,28,very enjoyable.
2574,11,"worth it, really enjoying it so far, beautiful graphics and good story line. play it for sure!"
2575,24,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2576,12,The game is THE best game of the last 2 years... Graphics are great. Gameplay is super smooth. Couldn't ask for much more. Maybe a few small features for aesthetics as far as editing your wand shape and type later on.
2577,2,AvAdA KaDaBrA!
2578,6,best oprnworld game
2579,17,"I'm trying to enjoy this game, but it's very difficult due to performance issues.I can run almost all game on high or ultra settings, so I believe my hardware is not the problem.I'll change this review as soon as it is fixed.Thank you."
2580,0,"I bought the game just to clearify that I hate trans people. That's it, I have nothing to do with jkr."
2581,23,Good Game
2582,4,"The game looks great, I cant wait to play it.. The game recommends I play on medium settings. Even with everything turned to the lowest settings, there is so much stuttering and lag its unplayable. Until the devs fix this issue for myself and many others, I cannot recommend."
2583,8,its just good
2584,23,absolutely great game to close this year.
2585,1,This game is amazing it makes me want to watch the movies and read the book.The gameplay is satisfiying and extremely funThe story is amazing right from the beginning.... im hookedIts one of the best games ive played in a very long time
2586,20,"Runs very well, haven't had any crashes or issues. It's a fun and beautiful game."
2587,21,"The game has strong start, the castle itself is gorgeous, combat is okay. And that is all for the positives. It gets progressively worse as you play, after 20 hours it's unbearable chore. Very repetitive and every game design decision is totally uninspired (even worse then the terrible Ubisoft open world games), the story itself lacks drama and emotional moments. Only recommended to Harry Potter fans who have no experience in gaming and modern OCD players who want dopamine hits from collecting every fart and achievement."
2588,9,Open world is amazing combat is great
2589,7,"Great game, only drawback is  that pc is not optimized as yet (16/02/2023). On a decent graphic card you barely get 60 fps. Other than that game is amazing."
2590,19,cant buy a broom kinda sad 
2591,21,REVELIO!
2592,13,All kids dreams comes alive! Good combats and the map is just huge and pretty accurate!
2593,18,"This is the game you've been waiting for. Totally open world Harry Potter. Great mechanics, great game."
2594,2,ur a lizard larry
2595,7,sheshh le jeu est vraiment lourd
2596,6,"I'm really enjoying this game. I've been wanting a RPG fantasy game for a while, and just couldn't get back into Skyrim. This scratches the itch."
2597,23,"Absolutely love it, minor lag issues, but aside from that it's a great game."
2598,2,Wazard man 10/10
2599,6,"asiqueeeee, seruu asliiii. suka bgt sama gamenya"
2600,8,I like to wizard and stuff
2601,6,Pretty dam fun :)
2602,6,Such a top quality game.
2603,6,Has Minor Issues Here and Their Graphical Side and Some Minor Stutters But Other Than That Game Is Good
2604,14,it's cool to be a wizard
2605,25,best story open world game ive ever played
2606,9,"Well it just came out but it's one of the best games Iv'e ever played!The graphics are amazing!The mechanics are amazing!And it's so very smooth!It's a bit slow at the start, but when you get really into it... I won't spoil."
2607,2,There is not one thing i can say about this game that i dont  like. If you are a harry potter fan this game is for you.
2608,18,"Pretty easy game on Normal, but lots of fun. If you like the Wizarding World this is pretty much everything you've hoped it would be."
2609,11,Mischief Managed
2610,15,Great game with tons of fun quests. The broom flying is fun and easy to get pretty good at. Combat and spell casting is honestly a 10/10 for me.
2611,12,Oh man what a great game and a great moment in harry potter history long time fan or not there is alot to love about this game
2612,32,Good game. Good mechanic. Tons of features to play. Many parts are suitable for those who love puzzle game.
2613,17,Pet. Cat. Yes.
2614,21,avada kedavra
2615,25,"So far it is very enjoyable, realising the imagination I experienced reading the books and films. Music is great!"
2616,3,"As of now, the game is solid. No Bugs, very entertaining gameplay. Could use more spice and some freeroam but I am not super far in. Recommended"
2617,8,"Is fun, end of review."
2618,10,I feel like a kid again.
2619,4,Slideshow on 3090 ti. Poorly optimized
2620,13,"great combat, great story, and amazing world to explore!"
2621,17,"One of the best, if not THE best game I have ever played"
2622,8,this game fucking slaps so hard. play it.
2623,7,I'm just a Load
2624,18,I am not a Potterfan but this game grabbed me from the beginning. It is wery good
2625,12,"It looks pretty and awed me at first, but this gameloop is insanely basic and feels like any ubisoft game with a harry potter skin on it, puzzles are way too easy and they just dump trash loot all over you. Feels pretty soulless."
2626,19,"Really good game , a lot of things to explore . If they can fix the dialogues I'll give it a 10/10 ."
2627,28,I hope they make a second one!! With Quidditch
2628,2,very good graphics
2629,16,Yer a wizard
2630,3,parry hotter
2631,25,Honestly thought this would flop but it's easily one of the best games i've ever played. Not even a massive Harry Potter fan either - up there with the likes of RDR2.
2632,29,Worth every penny <3 <3
2633,66,One of the best games I have ever played. I feel as if I am really there. Great job! Hufflepuff forever!
2634,30,Living my evil witch era through this game. Literally consumes all of my extra time right now lol.
2635,38,SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
2636,37,Great game with great initial pacing. The setting carries the game as there are really no good or memorable characters. There are plenty of open world activities and combat is enjoyable.
2637,4,everything
2638,9,"praying for the performance fix update, also maybe tone down the repeating lines in high traffic areas"
2639,14,good game
2640,28,"10/10 environment7/10 exploring8/10 gameplay3/10 storyWould highly recommend to any existing fans of the series. If you're just into open world games, probably worth a pick up too."
2641,2,nice game
2642,3,great game just a bit laggy
2643,27,Professor Garlick On Top
2644,9,10/10 for adding prof garlick
2645,18,"Like a movie that was based on a book, don't go into it with expectations and you will really enjoy this game."
2646,9,Fantastic game. Every harry Potter fan should play it if you want to fulfill your fantasy of being a wizard and explore the school of Hogwarts.
2647,9,worth the hype!!!!
2648,19,Amazing game for any Harry Potter fan.
2649,12,Is literally working out my Hogussy
2650,21,Worth the hype.
2651,3,very immersive
2652,28,we wait for a game like that for a long time
2653,10,"This game is absolutely amazing. I highly recommend it for harry potter lovers! the story is amazing, graphics are good and there is so much to explore and discover."
2654,8,Proffesor Garlick she really helped me realise how much I enjoyed herbology was never late for one of her lessons as she was just that good of a teacher.
2655,2,"From a huge harry potter fan: this game is a high production mess of endless grind with none of the character soul nor relevant moral choice to turn the main character into something interesting.Magic is and always was a backdrop to asking you who you are- Brave Neville, clever Hermione, strategic Ron, and what would you do under pressure?I, like Severus Snape would have said 'always'.Not this time. I was so excited. I'm so bored.And our first potential friendship moment happens in the library with sebastian and we just...... get no choice and a shitty cutscene?ALSO HOW DOES TIME WORK? THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN LONG GONE after fighting through like 20 guards.AND THERES NO TIME TURNER.This is Harry Potter for chat GPT brought to you by Brawndo. Its what plants crave.Not me though I'm out."
2656,4,"Love this Game soooo much, besides the really minor Bugs here and there. 10/10 would recommend!"
2657,7,A few bugs but overall a fun game
2658,10,Well done
2659,14,"Great game both on the mechanics, lore and amount of quests"
2660,22,"good shit, play it if you have nothing to do"
2661,5,No. ( Proper review to be added. )
2662,20,"much love, I haven't play it through yet, but until now, it is a great game for Potterheads. But i gotta say, it's a normal open world RPG - nothing special or new gameplay techniques. I will update the post, when i am done."
2663,6,this game is an absolute adventure like we've never seen in a video game before.
2664,4,"It's been a fairly miserable experience so far. Characters are overly kind, could seriously not care less about the villain or even care to remember their name, next to no roleplaying in terms of gameplay or player expression. This was shat out in the Unreal 4 application."
2665,16,The best game I have ever played in the harry potter universe. Everyone must play this masterpiece.
2666,6,I love this game! 10/10
2667,5,Awesome game 10/10
2668,27,"душно, но прикольно"
2669,7,"Wow, turns out that your game sells well and being popular despite what sick people on Twitter say, who would have thought"
2670,6,saved characters were all magically deleted .. good thing i wasted 60$ on this
2671,9,very good
2672,8,shadow wizard money gang we love casting spells
2673,11,Great game.
2674,29,"You can't say i didn't give it a fair chance.. At the beginning I really enjoyed the game, but it turned into a repetitive, boring grind very fast. The story is poorly written full of plotholes, nothing you do matters. I choose the ""bad"" ending but was still praised as a hero of the school, excuse me? I never felt like I was part of the world in any means, whatever I did had no impact. Using forbidden spells in front of anyone? No consequence, it's not even acknowledged. Randomly shooting people with anything? Same thing.Performance is bad, graphics are questionable, RTX settings are just for decoration. It's a real shame, there was way more potential in this than what it turned out to be."
2675,6,Great game.
2676,12,yes for 2 reasons. 1. The game is actually really good and I'm not even a HP fan. extraordinary game play.2. I love buying a game and supporting to piss off people who's first thought is to cancel.
2677,17,amazing game
2678,43,"50hrs, story completed, 100% challenges, was fun!"
2679,9,For what I saw it's a really good game. Lot's of easter eggs. Minor bugs (Like specific graphic cards get's water bugs)
2680,25,"recommend however lots of stutter , will probably be fixed in an update"
2681,4,"Nice open world content.  Almost as if Skyrim and Harry Potter had a baby! Great game so far, and worth the price with the DLC"
2682,16,6/10 || 7/10 If Harry Potter fanVery average game.Pros1. Amazing visuals and world building/exploration2. Combat is simple but feels flashy and nice. Spells are fun.3. Dialogue is okay. Some side quests are interestingCons1. Really generic protagonist2. Cliched main story3. Choices don't really matter much and puzzles are subpar4. Inventory and gear system is all over the place and there is no build variety5. Combat never really gets difficult and you can spam spell for the win
2683,6,Fantastic time capsule into Hogwarts history.  Great story and stunning visuals. Any fan of HP will live this. A must buy.
2684,4,"Best played in 3D in a VR Headset - SBS Gameplay and Tutorial:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68dVZa3WXXYThis game in 3D is nothing short of STUNNING!And if you already OWN the game its FREE to add 3D and give it a try! That in my book is a WIN, WIN Situation."
2685,37,one of the best games i have ever played
2686,8,if you get it working it is 10/10make sure you update your graphics driver!!
2687,24,Wingardium Leviosaaaaaahhhh.
2688,15,Honestly love the game and im not even really a HP fan
2689,8,WINGARDIUM leviosUghHHHH YES DADDY HARDER DEEPER UghHHHH 10/10

2692,3,It's LEVIOOOOUUUSAARRRR!!!
2693,23, Must Buy Zoo-Wee Mama! 10/10
2694,10,"If you like HP at all, you will love this game. Most detailed, lively open world game I've experienced in a long time. Great job devs."
2695,32,it's just so good
2696,16,Exploring Hogwarts is top tier in this game
2697,37,great game immaculate
2698,2,Incredibly fun
2699,33,After playing the game for 50+ hours without any problems the most recent patch destroyed everything for me.I bought the Deluxe Edition and RTX 4070 Ti specifically to be able to play this game but the stuttering makes the game a veritable slideshow. I have even tried to restore the game files to the previous version - didn't help.Feeling scammed right now as I am unable to play the game.
2700,5,Very fun. Fantastic story
2701,11,Wow a game actually worth its price and released without any major issues. GOTY quality. 
2702,43,Only wish I could cast Adabra Kedavra on Sebastian.
2703,4,i like the game as a whole
2704,6,Game of the Year
2705,22,"This game has a little bit of everything. The 3 unforgivable spells with intuitive combat, exploration, problem solving, and decorating your Room of Requirement and Vivarium (for all you animal lovers out there)."
2706,28,professor garlic is the only reason i bought this game
2707,29,Fun game!
2708,20,Now in my top 3 RPG games with a beautiful world and involving story + gameplay
2709,28,Super fun and exiting game. Lots of story and and amazing open world game.
2710,4,This is a decent TV Series.Hope they make a game out of it one day.
2711,18,awesome game
2712,12,p.u.s.s.y popper
2713,6,"I game based in 1800's Inner American City place called Hogwarts, its really immersion breaking."
2714,15,"Nice fan service, the rest of the game sucks"
2715,13,I really enjoyed the game especially between steamdeck and my pc.
2716,19,It is everything you want it to be and more. This is the first game I've played that has made my inner child so happy - the honking daffodils get me every time.
2717,26,worth it
2718,14,missing the legendary spell cockandballtortium :/
2719,21,LOVE THIS GAME
2720,17,Amazing Game. Is a bit jumpy and texture/world loading in has been slower since new update.
2721,27,fucking amazing game
2722,23,REVELIO! simulator. Highly recommend
2723,27,its great just need to add dragon taming
2724,22,Awesome game. EVERYONE should play it

2767,20,"It's just, WOW..."
2768,17,"Excellent game, with almost to much to do. Awesome graphics. Story is good, but slightly weak. Game play is fun. The world feels very Hogwarts. Some framerate issues, even on top tear hardware. i would still recommend this game to any gamer or HP fan."
2769,12,mm yes a fine game
2770,21,Yes.....
2771,2, have to say when i first heard of this game I was extremely skeptical but after giving it a chance and playing it i have to say it is the greatest game of 2023 so far
2772,105,Lots of fun.
2773,2,Seems good so far.
2774,18,"If you love Harry Potter universe this lets you experience where you have your adventure in this world , and have some of the details you would expect based on lore"

2807,29,Great Game for anyone who loves the HP World
2808,38,It's just like magic
2809,9,not really honestly. harry potter has always been a series i kinda liked. and i was hoping to be immersed into the world with this game. it honestly was fun for a bit. but it grew stale overtime. its probably just me and my odd taste though.combats flunky. and i ended up finding it far too easy even on the hardest difficulty. and i really hated the bullet sponge enemies who like lunge at you from across the battlethe games buggy. and runs like shit as well. it appears the devs really didnt know. or bother to optimize it that well. the game isnt THAT good looking to chug like it does. this is most obvious in cut scenes. for some reason(probably not pre-rendered?) either way. i am not crying over it. i got it for free anyway. but. its honestly. kinda mid. and the whole controversy and community isnt really..the best to put it lightly. i feel the devs really want to seperate themselfs from the whole controversy and be for everyone. they even have a trans character in the game. all in all. its a mid game honestly. but it might just be what is a harrypotter fans wetdreams. i dunno if its alright to buy. considering JK's stances on some human rights issues. but its not gonna harm her pocket if you dont buy it anywayoverall. i dont reccomend it. personally at least. for it being mid. and ethical concerns
2810,9,"One fucking great game! Didn't expect it to be this good and is quite 1 to 1 representation of the HP World.Great gameplay, visuals and works great.10/10"
2811,20, i have no issues with the game it plays amazing and i have been glued to it since the early acces

2821,28,Best game I have played in a while :)
2822,7,"Very user friendly, allows to understand the game if not a gamer. very easily playable"
2823,6,"PC performance issues are shocking, games been out for a week and still no fixWait till the devs actually care enough about their audience to patch the game"

2834,19,"""anything from the trolley dears?""""AVADA KEDAVRA!!!"""
2835,0,"Honestly it feels like an interactive movie aimed at consoles and not PC's. The game requires you to press a different button for various actions. It's pretty anti-immersive. The way the cutscenes are also done is more like a movie, unlike how Half-Life tackles such things.If you fixed up the controls, there may be something special."
2836,12,Awesome game. Couldn't have asked for better! :)

2871,2,"The map guide should be spiders!!!!! :P All in all, so far i am enjoying it with my trusty wizard Wallenby to curse Ron Weasley for the rest of his life :P"
2872,30,It doesn't break any new ground but its what I always wanted out of a Harry Potter game.
2873,7,Great game and Just needs Multiplayer to be epic.
2874,31,adictive
2875,16,"If you're into the potter universe, you should buy this game, but not yet. Hold off until the performance issues are fixed, as currently, even after the recent 300 mb update, the game still drops to 5 fps relatively often whenever loading in new areas or in combat, which just takes away from the experience. That being said, the game is great. Not as long as reported, the devs claimed there was 30+ hours of main storyline quests, whereas I only had 20 hours worth including a bunch of exploration, side quests etc. Bottomline I rate the game:World 10/10Combat 8/10Customization 9/10Exploration 9/10Story 7/10Performance 3/10Save the experience for when the game is optimized. "
2876,7,gREAT GAME
2877,6,Ideal way to release your inner transphobe
2878,31,"fun combat but repetitive. diverse amount of spells, a lot of simple brain dead puzzles, insane amount of dialogue. makes you appreciate dark souls games for their lack of dialogue. would only buy it on sale."
2879,8,yes u can kill people and be cool wizard man yes very good
2880,10,Avada Kadavra
2881,49,Best game a play so far! One word - REVELIO!
2882,17,avada kedavraaaaaaaaa
2883,46,I can pet cats
2884,17,"Best open world RPG since Witcher 3, hands down. And this coming from a person that does not care about the IP at all, never read the books, never seen the movies. The game however is pretty amazing."
2885,5,twitter sucks
2886,2,too much talking not enough action. im sure the game is amazing but i cant walk for 2 minutes without talking or cut scenes!! it's annoying as hell for players that want more fighting and a lot of FPS drops
2887,25,gas game. reminds me of my childhood. if yall mad about this game think about the clothes you wear that were made by a 8 year old kid in a sweat shop and then touch grass. ITS A VIDEO GAME lolol
2888,26,It's like something out of a storybook!
2889,16,Amazing game with lots of content to do. Instead of waiting for crack I highly recommend you buy this game now. Screw trans people and their disgusting broken psyche. 9/10
2890,42,Schon lang nicht mehr so viel spaß gehabt
2891,17,"Massive game, very immersive - love the gear customisation and the combat. Look forward to expansions for this game"

2896,10,One of the best games i have ever played
2897,17,"Fantastic, immersive game. Atmosferic, vast! And I am not even a Harry Potter fan!"
2898,33,Best Harry Potter game so far.
2899,19,"Amazing game, only issue I have is that you get spammed with new gear"
2900,13,"Side Quest walls make this game extremely boring, endless grind simulator with weak mechanics. Better have few solid one."
2901,14,"It's very hollow. The majority of the characters are empty and bland, leaving them to feel designless, like they're just some random background NPC in both appearance and personality. It feels like everything is hiding, nothing sticks out besides some of the visuals and architecture of the world, everything has a very witchy cosy vibe and it's quite nice, but in this cosy world it's full of waste, endless trash loot and boring collectables, so so many boring collectables. leave me alone Merlin I don't want to see your cutscene for the 100th time just to increase my inventory by 10 slots. At least the clothes are cute and the transmog system is REALLY good and easy to use.Your character is perfect at everything (Besides moving, you float around and control really badly), you're a dandy do-gooder and ALSO a chosen one of sorts. You make your character but it's not really yours, you have no flaws or downsides to your character, your dialogue choices are empty and without consequence. Speaking of character, the character creation is very mediocre (you can't change gender, skin or face type later on which sucks), just an okay amount of presets, no sliders. It's a boneless game, very soft, no edges. Also, it's very strange to see how horrible people are being, especially more left leaning people as you'd think they might be a bit more sympathetic towards things. Seems like people are making themselves ""The good guys"" by hating this game for ideological reasons and that gives them an excuse to be a horrible toxic person. Regardless of what you think is morally good or bad you are still a horrible vitriolic person and it's pretty sad. Not very wholesome cosy core witch at all."
2902,18,"When i promised myself to never have high hopes for hyped games anymore, This game breaks that promise"
2903,4,couple of fps issues I noticed while playing but mostly a solid game
2904,18,yes yes its really hard to turn this game off
2905,1,Good game

2912,21,Never miss Herbology class
2913,0,i don't get it
2914,5,half baked game - put it back in the oven.every 5 mins of playing this game the pc starts to sound like a lawn mower.
2915,2,"The graphics are amazing ( even though my gpu is trash) and the gameplay is utterly Overwhelming. 100% recommended, although I have to say I normally don't really enjoy solo player games"
2916,6,"The game looks nice and would feel good to play but even on the lowest settings I am only running on 10-20 FPS on my GTX 1080 and I have a few friends that have the same problem with newer cards. Please fix the optimization, I really wanna enjoy the experience."
2917,25,10/10 a student mind controlled a goblin to kill itself
2918,61,absolutely amazing game that we have all been waiting for. beautiful gameplay. big world with loads to do. you defiantly will not go wrong getting this masterpiece.

2936,18,"Best solo game i have ever touched, but its weird that a Harry Potter game doesn't have Quidditch or some sort of online duelling but 100% recommend if you like harry potter!"
2937,5,Damn this Game is SO GOOD... Check the review on my Youtube Channel HAGANA GAMING
2938,29,The game is damn good. Just play it and ignore the shit on twitter
2939,6,Fun game
2940,0,Cannot even start the game
2941,17,*snobbish* despite the stuttering... *makes majestic wand movements* MAGNIFICO!
2942,3,The game is worth all the hype.  I was going to play the opening and head to bed at a reasonable time but its now 3:10 AM.  Puts a spell on you for sure.
2943,6,Absolutely a BANGER. First Single player game that has captivated me like this has in a very long time .
2944,1,Lost for Words.
2945,28,Amaing game works well and no issues. Loads to do to pass the time
2946,11,"one of the best magic games i have ever played. wish there was a bit more memorable sisde character interaction but other than that, spot on story, combat and exploration."
2947,13,WHAT A CAT THIS GAME IS/ PO POLSKU CO ZA KOT ZA GIERKA
2948,33,"So far is good! Some dungeons and dialogues are repetitive at some point, Also the puzzles are repetitive and the enemies. But whatever its Hogwarts :D"
2949,13,RAVENCLAW FOR THE WIN!!!!!
2950,15,GOOD GAME
2951,19,"If you like Harry Potter, I recommend the game. Beautifully crafted environments, lot's of lore tibids and side quests that enhance the world.Otherwise, it's a fairly mediocre open world game. The main story is average, there is some crafting and collecting if you're into that. Combat is okay, enemies are little too spongy, and it's mostly just about rotating dodge, parry, spellcast and basic attack. I didn't particularly like dungeon exploration and puzzles. Overall, it feels similar to an open world Assassin's Creed game.Considering you're not a Harry Potter fan, I wouldn't pay more than $30 for it (hence the negative review)."
2952,24,"Very fun, love open world concept"
2953,43,Best game since Witcher 3 and Dragon Age.
2954,7,I am getting more transphobic by the minute. Good Game!

2961,6,HOW DO I USE THE GUN WAND MOD
2962,7,Precious game. However there is some hard lags during the cut scene . Hope they'll fix that soon.
2963,21,"This game is ruining mine and my boyfriends relationship, I am holding his computer hostage until I have completed this game because I refused to upgrade my PC...."
2964,4,you gonna learn spells nd sh**
2965,10,Really reminiscient
2966,12,"HP is one of my dearest memory of childhood. I had high expectation of this game. However, the dev have yet to fix this shuttering issue. This issue have been going on since early access and the recent ""performance patch"" on 14 Feb did not fix this issue. I know I should be patient but we as a consumer should have the right to play an ""OPTIMIZED"" release game.I lost all magical feeling for this game.The dev should had address this issue on their social media to restore players confidence instead of keeping us in the dark.As such, I don't recommend this game to anyone who is a potterhead. Unless you want to get your childhood destroy in this incomplete game.This review will still be negative if the shuttering issue is fix down the road to remind myself that game dev nowadays love to release ""UNOPTIMIZED GAME"" and doesn't care for the players."
2967,7,"Absolutely stunning detail and art throughout the game. Combat feels perfect as well, highly recommend."
2968,3,cant attack students
2969,17,good games. still some bugs but its new so whatever.
2970,6,Great game
2971,5,i swear to god if i am one of those 'reading reviews on different games' vids
2972,7,"This game looks nice. That's the only good thing I can say about it. Everything about the game play is awful. It's so bad that it's hard to pick where to start. The core experience is a never ending scavenger hunt. There are hundreds if not over a thousand random useless things hidden all over the world for you to find. That's wildly annoying on its own, but it is made worse by many of these items being locked behind shallow puzzles that exist to waste your time, if not locked behind spell specific locks to force you to retread the same areas multiple times as you unlock those spells. Some puzzles and locks require you to complete a puzzle lock to access them, and because that's not enough excess, you have to spend the entire game spamming your magical sonar to reveal the vast majority of collectibles. The sonar sees through floors and walls so you can't even access many of these items while others are barely revealed for less than a second before vanishing so you have to keep spamming the sonar and hunting the ping to find them. By the 4th hour I was ready to abandon this pointless waste of time, but collecting crap is required to level up, so you can't even opt out of it.The game loves to waste your time. The castle is a maze and the wider world is a vast expanse of beautiful nothing. It's a slog to retread. The devs obviously thought so too, so they put fast travel points every few feet. You must find them by almost touching them first and then you can travel to them, but the map is locations within locations within locations and no details, so you seldom know where you need to go, so you end up walking there anyways. On the subject of wasted time, entering your map or menu screen has a several second delay. Then there are about 9 or 10 tabs in the menu and there is a delay between each. You will constantly be using these so expect to lose several minutes every play session waiting on menu screens to load. This game is a big budget triple-A game in all the worst ways. So you better believe the bloat and excess and waste of time continues into your clothing. Each piece of clothing has stats and slots. You are inundated in new clothing. So you are constantly entering the menu, tabbing over to gear, entering each piece and swapping to your +1 better gear. But then you look like a freak with all this wacky gear so the devs give you the ability to use the cosmetics of any piece of gear you have owned on any piece of gear, so if you like not being a mismatched multicolor nightmare now you must back out of your newly equipped piece of gear and re-enter using a different button to reset the visuals of the gear. Why was clothing not 100% cosmetic? Why couldn't stat increases have been tied to your character rather than gear since any piece of gear can look like any other piece of same type of gear? It's multiple pointless systems and steps just to bloat the experience.As bad as everything is, somehow combat is worse than all of the rest combined. It is a cumbersome unintuitive disaster. 12 buttons, 2 sticks, and a D-pad. Every other game has figured out how to put an entire game worth of controls into these. This game couldn't figure it out. You have an attack button if you tap it, but to cast spells you must hold it and use a face button, but there are dozens of spells and only 4 spaces so you must equip and unequip them in a separate menu. You better believe that menu is also stupidly designed. Expect to be constantly swapping spells. You also have spells you can't remap on the D-pad, including magical sonar. There is a lock-on that struggles against multiple enemies which is every battle and a free aim that you will seldom use and can't use with some magic. It's weird and hard to explain how bad it is. Actual combat usually throws multiple enemies at you. Each waits a second or two, then does a 1 second telegraph before instant teleport attacking you or range attacking you. You have a dodge and shield that functionally do the same job, but these are face buttons so you can't be in the process of doing other magic when it is time for your quick time event dodge. You are constantly swapping between dodging, blocking, and trying to spam some damage on damage sponge enemies. By the time you are able to enter the wider world enemies all come with different colored shields that can only be temporarily broken with specific magic, so you need a range of specific magic equipped, and then you must fight targeting to select the right enemy, hold attack and choose the correct face button to break that shield, then spam your attack or use one of your other face spells to attack, and at any time multiple enemies can be instant killing you from the other side of the room. Enemies are all tanks. You die in 2-3 hits on hard, about 4-5 on normal, and that's while you are overleveled and in the best gear. Everything about combat feels awful.Everything about the gameplay sucks, but somehow everything outside of the gameplay sucks too. You would expect that as a student in a magic school you would attend classes and in your free time do other stuff. You will spend days and nights wandering the vast countryside and committing murder against murderers, and when you feel like it you can occasionally do a class mission as a tutorial. Did I mention yet that the entire game is nothing but tutorials. Don't expect to learn anything because while the tutorials tell you what they want you to do, they refuse to explain HOW to do them. You will have to learn to play on your own time while being murdered in the field or while hunting for the 54th hidden book page in the 27th location. Each location has its own collectathon goals. Nothing you do makes it feel like you are a student. The game should have just had you be an adult wizard fighting dark wizards. The school exists as just a maze full of things to collect. You are forced to engage with npcs that are mostly miserable and shallow. I ran into a lady who had dedicated her life to unlocking a mystery no wizard has ever solved. I then solve it in a second and she abandons her life's work because she was just a tutorial 10 hours into my play time. Students are universally annoying and give you fetch quests or just want to waste your time. It would be fine if any of them were likable, but they aren't. The teachers are all fine but you barely interact with them outside of their missions/tutorials, which often involved doing other missions/tutorials to fulfill theirs. The game just goes on and on with its excess, bloat, frustrations, and time wasting. I didn't mention learning spells. It's an mini-game of pointing down a path and occasionally tapping a button. I never failed, but I imagine if you do you just redo it because you MUST have these spells to progress the game. So why have these in the game at all? They accomplish nothing and have no stakes. I also didn't mention the stuttering or characters with faces that don't load or animate while they are talking. Honestly, glitches, bugs, and poor performance are the least of the game's issues. I wanted this game to be good. I liked the books. But it dropped the ball in every conceivable way, except for looking nice. I will take a good game that looks like crap any day over a bad game that looks nice."
2973,32,This game has lots of potential.
2974,35,Fucking just played almost 60 hours on this game and for it to crash my computer deleting my whole save .. was about 65 % of the way in with all the quests and everything.. AAA+ games have gone to major hell.. and now its discerning playing this losing a whole save .
2975,22,quem não gosta tá errado
2976,16,Verry nice game relly do try it
2977,6,love this game honestly can play it for hours only thing stopping me from doing that is work
2978,13,definitely worth it some performance issues tho hopefully it will be patched
2979,32,"Amazing game with an amazing experience. great combat, great story, huge world, and tons to keep you invigorated with the magical world"
2980,26,10/10 GOTY for sure. Dont listen to potato pc people. Play this game
2981,7,игра норм токо фпс хуйово
2982,6,i love this game i feel like i am 12 again watching harry potter for the first time. i would give it a 9/10 so far i am having a blast if you like harry potter you'll like this game.
2983,6,"fantastic story, good game play and amazing graphics"
2984,2,Amazing game!
2985,13,"Great story and voices, Cool environment, top game."
2986,4,Best game in 2023
2987,26,"Only one thing is missing in this game, breeding phoenix."
2988,14,its the best game that i have ever played
2989,10,"Best open world story mode game ever. Worth getting, hoping they will make a mutiplayer or co-op"
2990,4,So far great. Just some bugs on new AMD GPUs
2991,29,"I'd rate this neutral if I could, but having to pick between good and bad I gotta pick the latter I'm afraid:Pro:- the World: Hogwarts is awesome, Hogsmeade is nice. The rest is... serviceable- combat is better than expected- music- visuals- voiceacting- atmosphere (in Hogsmeade/Hogwarts anyway)Cons:- all the copy pasted open world garbage: It's all so basic and identical that I don't think you could even simplify it further. 'Cairn dungeons' is the phrase they use to describe a tunnel of 200m length with a chest at the end. They copy pasted the very same cairn 'dungeon' about 150 times. Spoiler: The tunnel has right, left turn. Don't get lost.- combat falls entirely flat towards the 2nd half. Same enemies, no customization and the stat system shows it's flaws: troll 3 levels above you will 1-2 shot you which is fine, but a troll 5 levels below you can't even touch you.- there's about 10 enemies in this game total. And that's being generous. Goblins/Dark Mages/Trolls/Spiders. These 4 cover 99% of enemies you'll fight.- performance is still fairly poor. It runs okay'ish on higher end hardware but nothing more. And on this point: The promised 'Day 1' patch came 1 week after pre-launch and did little to nothing.- Difficulty: I played on hard and was a breeze. I understand this isn't a Souls game. But there's difficulties for the casuals, where is the difficulty for people who like a challenge?- Controls are kinda clunky, both on controller AND M/KB. Consumable wheel especially.- bunch of minor bugs, but mostly non- consequential. The only notable one for me: unfinishable sidequest (Biscuit)- you spend way too little time in Hogwarts. And the game encourages quicktravel and following the map blindly way too much.- accessibility settings aren't well thought out. I wanted to play without minimap and assistances to stop myself from mindlessly going from one world objective to the other, but there's not even a compass without the minimap...- Hogsmeade? More like Alohomeade. Seriously, there's nothing here other than shops and about 50 Alohomora 'Puzzles'- doesn't matter at all what house you play- this would've been better as a regular RPG focusing on Hogwarts and its immediate surroundings. With a regular character experiencing Hogwarts first time instead of all these grandiose plots. But its Warner Bros, so of course you're some random 5th year who just so happens to be the best wizard of all time. Excelling at everything the moment you touch it.  Oh and your magic is special too of course, no one else has it.- ... and of course you're the hero too, no choices on that matter, no dark path."
2992,12,vry good
2993,60,"Now remember children, it's Wingardium Leviosa, swish and flick"
2994,12,"This game has a great feel to it, the detail is amazing and the soundtrack really brings it all together."
2995,17,Fun game poor optimization.This trend is getting very annoying.I don't like paying $60-$70 for games day one too have issues.Adding denuvo to a game knowing it causes performance issues is poor business.Unfortuanetly i cant refund the game but never will i pre order or even pay full price for a game from wb?portkey.
2996,6,Good game
2997,34,decent game but brings nothing new to the genre and it does most things worse then other titlesif your a HP fan its a must play but if your not i would suggest the AC series insteadalltho HHogwarts legacy got a mcuh more interesting combat system6.5

3028,12,"great game, visuals, music, interfaces, story and characters are all well done. 9/10 so far with 20 hours into the main story. only complaint is the lack of inventory space at the beginning if you opt out of the Merlin Trials right away."
3029,8,good game. not mid.
3030,6,About as good a harry potter game as you could ever hope for. Story could be better but everything else is wonderful.
3031,39,Good Game.
3032,3,i highly recommend this game
3033,12,"Yer a wizard, Harry."
3034,8,"Credit given to the developers that worked on graphics, map layout, and combat. Now to why I gave a thumbs down and do not recommend this game.The story and gameplay is like most new modern western games. Just soullessIts a hollow world, think of cyber punk and how the city just feels so empty its the same. With a trash story. The Npcs are soulless, the main characters there are none except some old guy. The story is really bad you somehow fighting and in the midst of a life and death situation and you have no clue why. The story is confusing some old guy has been with a goblin so you gotta fight their battles? Atleast in Harry Potter got the batman feel of someone killed the parents, this mc is just there with no back story.All npcs are void. You cant really make friendships or date any of the girls. I think Western games need to look at Jrpgs and take elements like Persona. Have doing these side quest give a reward like a date. Like why cant you date a girl, where are the cute girls?! There should be story lines with dating, have them be a part of the main quest save the damsel in distress. Nah instead ur helpin some old random guy for god knows why.Persona has you thinking like should I date and be loyal the cute girls finally here and once you finally start another hot girl comes along now its your decision be loyal, or go behind their back. Do you get caught or not you might loose this side character. Theres also no music, wheres the goosbump given music not even the original harry potter song can be heard. The loot system is terrible too, money dosnt matter theres a chest at every corner with a 200 coin worth vest or hat that increases your skill by 20 so your unstoppable. Again another western mechanic everything is handed down and not earned. Its so boring idk how people like that. Jrpgs you work for every item it makes it special and earned.Guess im just in culture shock seeing how great Japans games are then coming to this"
3035,4,The game is awesome. The world is awesome and beautiful. All characters are awesome. Buying game on all platforms.
3036,16,This game would become 1000% better if Professor weasley was a dommy mommy
3037,7,please fix stuttering and FPS drop
3038,18,Best game since gta5
3039,7,"12 hours. Corrupted save file, cause why? no fucking reason. Game updates. Cloud saves fail for what ever reason. Cant recover them via steam cloud from 2 days ago because reason. Can see part of the cloud saves but no my actual game files. Now I've got to start again. FML."
3040,5,became a racist wizard.
3041,9,Game is stuck for me after playing for 12+ hours; no matter what I do the character doesn't move. I don't want to load an old saved file and redo everything. Please devs stop releasing games to the public without proper testing.
3042,23,"Gameplay is very good but unfortunately woke nonsense is rampant throughout!Ethnic minorities everywhere you look, be they the students or even the majority of the teachers - which would be fine if the game was set in the Bronx but its not!! This game is supposed to be set in 1800s Scotland!!!A tr@nny barmaid to cap it off and let's not forget woke dialog all throughout the game! Can't we even play a video game now without woke crap being thrust down our bloody throats?!Its a good game but for these reasons it does not deserve a thumbs up, these game creators need to wake the F*@# up and realise that we do not want this bull*@# in our games."
3043,2,Noice Game
3044,28,Merlin's beard!
3045,25,Worth it for the gameplay but the price for such a short story is not worth
3046,16,SO worth the money!!!
3047,3,Good game! I loved it
3048,26,A great game well worth the money. Get lost in Hogwarts magic and watch the time fly by.
3049,1,Performance issues make it unplayable to me...
3050,15,I love this game so much but I logged on and my saves were wiped and had to start all over again. It happened to me twice and I had 25 hours on my character. Hoping they will fix this or hope they already did. Other than that Its an AMAZING game.
3051,10,Your a wizard harry
3052,5,"Amazing gameplay, story, and scenery. 10/10 Welcome to Hogwarts."
3053,16,"Very well made world that apart from the school is sadly empty and lifeless. Low amount of spells, no quidditch and no interaction with NPCs. Very linear story that is mid at best. Overall I'd recommend it only on a discount."
3054,4,i've been searching all over the map and i still haven't found gandalf

3063,8,Its the best harry potter experience considering the movies too
3064,14,"Great game. Story didn't really capture me, but the world and Hogwarts itself is mindblowing. Combat is fun and finding each enemy's unique weakness is super satisfying. Give it a try for sure!"
3065,14,"Its a great harry potter esc game. Its definitely on the childish and light side compared to many fantasy/magic action rpgs out there, but it offers a fun story with a great map and area to explore."
3066,28,One of the best games I've ever played and I'm not even that into HP. The real ones go Hufflepuff

3077,51,10/10 when DLC ?
3078,52,"I love the game. I love exploring the world. If you can run it it's one hell of a game. I am uninstalling it for now though until the game is fixed in terms of performance, I hope it is soon."
3079,18,Best Game ever!! <3 Perfect!!! Worth the money <3
3080,18,THIS GAME IS WONDERFUL!

3082,5,"Great game, any harry potter fan will thoroughly enjoy"
3083,20,Awesome game. WAY better than I expected and highly recommended for all RPG fanes out there
3084,37,If you try to do away with everyone who's opinion is not your own then you are no better than a cult. All life styles and opinions are accepted as long as they agree with me is bs. Great game that I didn't miss because I'm not asleep anymore.
3085,2,good game
3086,4,"This Review is only because of bad performance. Game looks great, game run poorly. It is currently unoptimised. I am '' testing the game'' at this point.- 32 Go Ram 3200 cl16- Ryzen 5 3600 (6 /12)- RTX 3070 (8G VRAM)- 32 inch (LGGK650F-B) (144hz 1440 P)- Win 11- All Driver ( Bios, windows, AMD CPU and GPU Nvidia are all uptated to the most recent patch)Issue:- Game dip from 120 ish to 15 fps everything at low no ray tracing (because why use that?)- Immense Stutter- FPS drop even cap at 60 fps or uncap /  Vsync in Nvidia on / off in gameI got fully Refunded after (7.8 hour steam) (91 minutes in game stat) because, even there, steam acknowledged that this game at this state, is not playable '' For a lot of user with different build''.My friend is using Intel CPU and RTX 3060Ti and he have the same issue.*** ( My GF is using an old CPU. ''intel I7 6800k and GTX 1070'' and she got less issue then I have!)This Review will be updated to Recommended when it will be fully patch. ( maybe in 3 years like Cyberpunk)"

3090,3,Ravenclaw represent!
3091,8,"Aside from poor, boring dialogues and NPCs the game is amazing"
3092,11,The amount of content is more then expected
3093,3,"If you're someone who doesn't have the time to complete this game in one or two sittings then I can't recommend this game as it apparently has a very common issue with game saves. I'm the type of person who manual saves just to be sure and still had all my files corrupted, only four hours in. I cant trust the game to not do the same thing again so I guess for now I will have to wait for a patch to come out that fixes it or go through the customer support of warner bros to request a refund.also, the frame drops are still terrible, way worse then what Elden Ring had going on when it dropped, and I might not have the beefiest graphics card (RTX 3050) but for around half my playtime the textures and pop-in the game were so terrible it was more reminiscent of a playstation 2 game than a new gen game (which is apparently another bug). Really immersive breaking. A shame no one is talking about it.Absolutly game breaking bug. I can't recommend it to anyone in the state its in."
3094,5,goood game
3095,11,how do i make garlick descendo on deez nuts tho

3126,36,Its Beautiful. Going to have a niffler army.
3127,40,Very poggers game.
3128,44,"This game is amazing, the story and gameplay make you feel like you are truly living your own wizarding world adventure, however I do not recommend getting this on PC unless your PC is high end, an extremely good graphics card is required, the minimum specs that it says is bullshit. Im running a bottlenecked NVIDIA GTX 1070 with 16GB of ram and its borderline unplayable with all the frame drops even at lowest settings. The game itself gets a 10/10 from me, however my money was wasted getting it for PC. In fact, this game has single handedly made me want to stop PC gaming all together and just get a high end console like PS5."
3129,2,Wizards n such. It's guud
3130,52,"The game was interesting to begin with. So Ill start with my bad points:The loot is just plain boring, No exciting Drops,The rewards are boring (Merlin trails),The NPC's characters feel a lifeless, Very little enemy variety,Too many repetitive puzzles,Too many fetch and grab side quests,Performance is terrible even with very good hardware,Can map enough spells as its a console UI,Flying feels like a clunky after thought,Forced to be goodGood Points:Looks nice when performance does not tank,Decent world size to explore,Combat is fun,So decent spells,An okay main story just wish there was more choices,Changing Seasons as you progress the story (feels like time moves),Overall not worth buying the collector edition. I would wait for a sale before purchasing this game if your only looking for a time sync."
3131,22,"No matter if you’re a Potter head, it’s the Ultimate Hogwarts experience!"
3132,34,Immersive and beautiful. Anything I could ever ask for in a game.

3164,38,"Absolutely loved it! It's a great game with a variety of characters and diversity in the way the main character looks and sounds, it really feels like you can play as yourself, whoever you may be. The story is great and the combat is so fun!"
3165,7,Awesome. Amazing. Would recommend to everyone.
3166,52,"Review: Very positive, the people hating on it only have 3 brain cells left."

3182,32,It's a fun game
3183,8,"Fire in all aspects of the game, I love that you can tell how much time they put into the game"
3184,8,An excellent open world game. Sad there is no multiplayer but it's cool if you like this type of games
3185,4,beautiful game
3186,7,your a lizard 10/10
3187,3,"im playing ultra settting in 4k on an oled display and this game looks terrible. it looks like a year 2005 game. supeerrrrrrr disappointing. there is nothing magical about how this game looks, nohting even close to what the movies look like. its a really ugly and boring game to play. but hey, its 2023, what more can one expect other then garbage "
3188,24,Cool game
3189,12,Haven't had this much pure fun in a new game in a long while
3190,6,"Sh*t optimization. One of the unlucky ones whose game just keeps crashing and i tried every solution and still crashes. I give up , negative review <3 Fu harry potter"
3191,28,woosh woosh i can be a scum bag in the wizarding world as well
3192,21,Todd Howard did it again.
3193,3,i couldnt recommend this mostly with $99 deluxe editionbought deluxe edition but the game was not what i expected. the first 2 hours was good. until the issues shows up. the fps drop all the time even i try in low mode graphics level. sync with controller was on and off sometimes. this could be amazing game but i dont think the system and implementation is there yet. i hope they could update it in next patch. this game have potential. but still a little bit disappointed with the issues and i cant recommend this mostly for deluxe editon after i spend $99 for it and came up with a lot of problems after 2 hours in the game and couldnt fix it even i tried every type of settings.
3194,32,I will play it again!
3195,46,"PROS:Cool graphics.CONS:Poor gameplay.Repeatable enemies and quests.World is dead, no interactions.A lot of ""lore accurate"" characters representing XIX century.All characters are doing nothing.No dialogue system.No relations with characters."
3196,4,"So far Hogwarts Legacy is an open-world game with magic, of course in the universe of Harry Potter. I'm really loving getting to explore Hogwarts and its surrounding areas."
3197,10,stunning game
3198,2,Controls is absolute shit for PC
3199,4,Ur a wizard cunt
3200,14,Better than MWII.
3201,16,Bartender is 100% smashing back polyjuice potion. Please notify the ministry.
3202,4,game is great
3203,8,magic and shit
3204,9,"Game runs pretty badly on a RTX 4090, huge stuttering. Some of the most dull and banal main character dialogue I've encountered in a game in many years. No innovative gameplay, you have played this game in some form many times already. Get it if it's $40 and you have absolutely nothing else to play"
3205,26,Great game all in all. But watch out! This game is really performance heavy. I have a RTX 2070 and my fps are still dropping from time to time.
3206,14,very fun
3207,21,One of the best
3208,27,"Absolutely worth the hype. If you like Harry Potter, get this. The free exploration of Hogwarts and surroundings is worth the price tag alone."
3209,24,avada kedavra!
3210,2,fun wizard casts spells n sht
3211,1,Sucks you right in!!!
3212,49,It was really fucking good and i am happy that i got it and finished it.

3228,2,wizard go brrr
3229,20,amazing !!
3230,28,Great Game. Love the combat. Combo's feels so fun and can be switched around so much. Exploring feels exciting everytime you do it.
3231,11,"This game is great except for Sirona Lyon, get that shit outahere"
3232,36,Absolutely love this game I can't stop playing highly recommended especially if you love Harry Potter movies it's like your in the movie
3233,27,This game is DOPE!
3234,18,best of earlier 2023
3235,7,This is what I hoped every Harry Potter game was. The games that came out with the movies were limited in their story and the mechanics were clumsy. This game is truly open world and it adds to the lore. Great game!
3236,4,"Very engaging, everything that I would have thought would be in a harry potter world. This game seems to be jam packed with stuff to do and things to learn."
3237,34,Recommended. Worth it 10/10.

3245,5,dont even know what a harry potter is but this game is fun and refreshing
3246,9,aiudrgSPUIGTESGt YAY!
3247,2,this shit is fire
3248,22,Love It!!!
3249,12,Awesome atmosphere and design. Fun battle system that is quite challenging - had to turn down from hard. But also partially because it's hard to have FPS in the chaos. I find this game extremely charming. It feels like entering a fantasy world.
3250,49,Good game for a playthrough. There is not much to offer in terms of replayability.
3251,2,The performance is terrible. FPS can drop all the way from 150 to below 20 for no reason on RTX 3080.
3252,36,AVADA KADAVRA
3253,17,"IS FUN! Don't know bout the main story, adhd brain go brrrrrrr, Ooh Shiny, and off on side quests i go."
3254,26,This is the best single player RPG I've ever played.
3255,25,"Лучшая игра по вселенной Гарри Поттера, приятно не спешно проходить"
3256,9,The view and the npc is totally great can just vibing here for hours.
3257,17,"Brilliant game ! If you're a fan of the world, this game will not dissapoint. Get it, don't think about it. You will not regret it"
3258,14,Great game!
3259,9,"I can play this game all day. Some of the scenes in the game reminded me of movie scenes, it's so beautiful and it would have been even better if you had Thai subtitles :)"
3260,12,"An amazing game that gets to put you right into the wizarding world and allows you to create your own story. With cool characters, good spells, awesome combat and story so far. I would say its worth a shot!"
3261,20,"Definitely, its a great game and a must play if you are a Harry Potter fan. 100% worth it"
3262,2,Fun Game
3263,50,one of the better games released in awhile. excellent for all ages. combat is fun and game is beautiful
3264,29,Good Shit
3265,37,"i so wanted this to compare to a game made 8 years ago (witcher 3) . This game did have some aspects of the witcher 3 but failed short on achieving versatility.  Legendary items are as common as greens. HL Doesn't really look good even on ultra settings. The reality is, games designed for consoles really limit the overall customizations of pc users. The keyboard layout is just nuts , trying to hit CTRL to doge and F3 for a combo spell switch without breaking your fingers is just not well thought out. Don't forget about keeping yourself healed too. oh well, just grind to fin"
3266,3,It's so easy to get lost in the open wizard world of Hogwarts. There's always some new thing to explore and enjoy.
3267,10,"Beautiful rich open world filled with story, exploration, and so many distractions.  After 17 hours I can tell I'm only scratching the surface.  Possibly the best gaming experience since RDR2."
3268,5,"As a fan, this is probably the best HP game so far. not comparable to other 3a games I love (witcher, elden ring) and the optimization is pretty bad.. hope they improve it soon!"
3269,26,"Disregarding current social trends, this game is very enjoyable."
3270,25,very nice
3271,6,FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC!!!
3272,13,"Fantastic Game, loving every minute of it! The game is truly magical."
3273,5,Simply a perfect magical Hogwarts open-world game that is a dream of every Potterhead becoming a hogwarts' student to explore this world
3274,25,"Amazing, never thought I'd see a Harry Potter game of this magnitude be this good."
3275,10,"Fantastic gameplay, immersive story telling, and an almost skyrim like freedom of action (after you progress in the story)."
3276,33,Top Wizarding World Game
3277,34,decent little 50+ hour game
3278,18,i like it
3279,20,The best Harry Potter game there is. Easily spent 30+ hours in it. The game’s good but the optimization not so much. Somehow the latest patch made everything worse. Hope this get fixed soon.
3280,7,get it lol its fun
3281,15,"I should go to bed, but instead I'm defeating dark wizards. 10/10 would lose sleep again."
3282,3,"guess im a transphob, pro slavery, racist, nazi now, but it was worth it. this game is good"
3283,19,i like dark magic very good
3284,8,It keeps crashing.
3285,3,sets a new benchmark in gaming
3286,11,wizard game good.
3287,56,Story and combat system are quite fun it's not very difficult but enjoyable
3288,13,Everything I have ever wanted in a Harry Potter game. I've played for 21 hours so far and I feel I have barely scratched the surface of what this game can offer. And you can pet all the cats! 10/10.
3289,7,"it's fuckin great, ride broomstick through rings and have a modern version of superman N64. spells and shit, you know, wizardry type stuff. get a mask that makes you look like you belong in a mental hospital. good game."
3290,14,"This review may change to a Yes with patches to improve performance and lighting bugs, but in its current state, it has too much stuttering and ray traced lighting pop-in, even with an RTX 4090. The game itself is brilliantly detailed with phenomenal combat and a good storyline, yet there is too much killing and enemy encounters in the open world to really feel like a 16-year-old Hogwarts student wandering the Wizarding World. The constant killing hampers the immersion and makes this just like another other generic open world RPG when not actively in a story mission."
3291,44,Amazing game!  A bunch of things to do and in the end it makes you feel super OP.  Not gonna lie Avada Kadavra is super OP but I love it!
3292,61,"its all they promised and more , the only negative thing its there its no more to play.Maybe a Second Part ?"
3293,2,Good game. spent 2 hours abusing a cat! would recommend
3294,52,Best game ever lowkey!
3295,56,"Combat is simple but fun.I like to run around and explore, but sadly I get lost in Hogwarts easilyWorld is big, but not to empty.Choises should matter more.I want to breed Phoenix also!"
3296,3,Magic so cooool
3297,45,"Literally just lost DAYS of work on this game.  Seriously, devs??"
3298,8,you can pet cats in this game 11/10
3299,16,Introduction of Professor Garlick 10/10
3300,18,wizard balls
3301,2,Wish I had more time to play this game but it is amazing!
3302,14,"“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all those who live without playing this game.”GREATES GAME OF ALL TIME"
3303,13,"Game is surprisingly challenging and very immersive. Also, game is beautiful. Very well done."
3304,12,very cool
3305,9,loved the game 9/10 the only issue i am having till now is the random fps drops when ever i open a gate outside the hogwarts castle
3306,7,Boring
3307,35,OHO A MERLIN TRIALProfessor Garlick has my heart <3
3308,19,very fun game
3309,22,"Love everything about this game, combat, small details, interactions, EVERYTHING. 10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND."
3310,10,"Amazing, exploration, combat, story all top notch. Sucks JK rowling is a terrible person :\"
3311,6,It's everything I ever wanted from a video game set in the Harry Potter universe.
3312,2,"游戏是好的，就是开光追前后帧数天差地别Great game, if they don't have ray tracing"
3313,3,"super cool and fun but make sure u can actually run the game, its laggy as hell when rendering new areas or maybe my settings are messed up idk"
3314,11,Beautiful game! Lots of exploring! I love it!
3315,7,unbelievably good
3316,24,A wish-come-true masterpiece
3317,11,"Slow start, but to be expected if you are actually going to learn as a student at hogwarts, which you are.  At level 17 I am doing some really fun stuff."
3318,18,Love this game! everything about it is so good! only downside is you cant tame a hippogriff and make it your mount. ive had over 30 hours of gameplay and im still not done playing!
3319,16,super dooper cool
3320,49,J.K. Rowling is a genius! The Wizarding World is definitely her turf.
3321,9,You can't imagine how inconvenient travel was before I invented floo powder.
3322,1,Very Fun
3323,2,"very good game, I love it."
3324,15,Should have been better. Latest patch broke the game and erased all my saves.
3325,0,"shit game, shit intro, shit control.  what's the point of spells if hey all do the same thing? spam a few controls and all combat is the same. can I un-dowload for money back? honestly like no option, get railed into one option for every action? it's like early 2000s options with some Xbox Oblivion level graphics. unless you are a potter stan this game seems like a waste. gotta spend at least 30min of non optional cut scenes and still not a single option that affects the game?  "
3326,6,Based and TERF pilled
3327,24,This has been a fantastic journey and a beautifully crafted experience that I did not want to end! Please DEVs create expansions for this!
3328,26,Great immersive Potter world
3329,44,very fun
3330,15,haha avada kedavra go brr
3331,2,Every time i boot it up it crashes
3332,9,"If you want simple fun, it's good"
3333,2,yeah sex is probably really cool but have you heard of playing hogwarts legacy (:
3334,47,sh0 sheesh
3335,12,Great game. Even better that it offends some people.
3336,25,"VERY VERY good game, WISH I COULD ROMANCE SEBASTIAN THOUGH"
3337,2,This game is cat petting simulation and i love it!not to mention about the drip in this game is fuego AF!keep yourself busy exploring away from main quest! there's a LOT to brain in the wild!
3338,2,the game is awesome
3339,4,"Amazing graphics, tons of quests, beautiful landscape 10/10"
3340,2,"The game is very beautiful, and being a die-hard Harry Potter fan myself, I really found this game worth it!"
3341,25,im what Voldemort would fear
3342,30,Veri nice gameIs veri gudMe like veri much
3343,25,Fun for any fan of theycraft and theyzardry.
3344,21,"Game is wonderful, Framerate is very chuggy in spots,  Cut Scenes, some interiors of Hogwarts,  streets of Hogsmead etc.  But gameplay is fun, did a really good job creating the World!!!"
3345,18,Check the politics at the door and enjoy the game. It really is impressive and provides hours of fun.
3346,47,Awesome game. Anyone want to buy some corn? Fresh sack of corn. good price for corn for you.
3347,7,"Adds so much to big hp fans, good game"
3348,2,"Looks good so far, such beautiful world design! i love it! <3"
3349,8,I thoroughly enjoy the game overall my only dislike is not being able to play quiditch was looking forward to that specifically but overall a really great game highly recommend
3350,31,Fantastic game if you love Harry Potter or video games!
3351,29,Good game!
3352,6,Best game i've played since Skyrim.
3353,26,"despite j.k. rowling's ....opinions this game is amazing and im glad it turned out how it did, it is a complete childhood dream of mine to have a hogwarts game like this."
3354,29,Lots of fun
3355,31,"Good game, 10/10. Can't wait to 100% it."
3356,27,"lots of puzzles to do, lots of places to explore,"
3357,14,My childhood dream came truee!!
3358,39,A fun open world game.
3359,19,love everything!
3360,16,"Lots to do, a game I will definitely try to 100%"
3361,36,This is has been the most addictive game I've ever played so far on PC. You can really feel the love the developers had for this game. 10/10 would recommend!
3362,7,the best game I have played since elden ring so much world detail and it look exactly like the movies and how the books describe  customization is very cool and useful and overall game content is entertaining and challenging 10/10 so far
3363,16,GOOD VERY GOOD :)
3364,33,Amazing game
3365,3,Extremely fun
3366,21,Truly amazing. 100000/10
3367,24,It's on sight with Arthur Plummly.
3368,9,great story runs like garbage i have a it in 1920 x 1080 resolution on the lowest settings and still get only a max of 40 fps in areas devoid of things to load. i have a Geforce Nvidia RTX 3060  12gigs vram ands an Intel I7-10700F 32 gigs DDR4 of memory so should be able to run like 60+ fps on 2560 x 1440 resolution like i can for most of my games so cant recommend until this is fixed
3369,22,Definitely worth the time and price it has a lot of side content and a good story plus the open flying feels really good especially after the upgrade
3370,4,"So far, amazing. It is like the Harry Potter games of my childhood times 20. VERY taxing on the PC. Be warned that unless you're rockin a 4090, sacrifices must be made graphically."
3371,11,"Best RPG I have played in a long time. I love how its not a Harry Potter game, but an RPG set in the Wizzarding World."
3372,4,"Beyond nostalgic, highly reccomend."
3373,18,"Literally the best. Thank you Port key games. that's all i have to say, it scratches all the itches."
3374,11,I don't play games like this. BRO. I bought this 2 days ago. 19 hours played so far. That's all i'll say.
3375,13,This game is EVERY THING you've EVER wanted from a wizarding game... Absolutely 5 Stars!
3376,7,this game is the tits.Dont take it for granted.Beauti.10 sexy wizards out of 10.
3377,11,very good game! spells and more! potter
3378,12,"Yur a wizard, Harry"
3379,2,"Detailed, excellent and captures the spirit of the books and the movies. You'll find yourself looking around and wondering why someone hasn't done this before now."
3380,15,"Great story, looks amazing. Some bugs but that's to be expected with a fairly large map and the detail that it has. Pretty good play time too, haven't touched to many side quest."
3381,25,This game is perfect. Exactly what you would want out of a harry potter game.
3382,7,this game is incredible the story the side quests it all works so well together
3383,17,"9/10  I dont leave reviews often, but this game is top tier. The only thing that would make it better is multiplayer (which the modding community is likely going to fix soon) if you are considering getting the game, do it. if you arent? do it anyway."
3384,14,very gud
3385,18,Awesome game! better include qudditch
3386,18,Really fun! lags a bit at times but there's mods to improve performance
3387,24,Yeet cats
3388,8,yer a wizard harry
3389,12,Sometimes it seems like all roads lead to hogsmeat.9/10 absolutely stunning game
3390,24,Fun game especially if you like the world of Harry Potter
3391,4,Addictive
3392,5,youre a wizard hairy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3393,29,Overall solid game so far.
3394,23,great game
3395,19,I can't stop smiling when I play this game :D. Big fan <3
3396,18,You can break pots and pet cats. 10/10
3397,2,Go Hard!
3398,29,"never really been a harry potter fan, bought the game for my wife.  color me impressed, this is easily one of the best games to release in the last 5 years hands down."
3399,10,"2 days worth of data was deleted i saved and left as usual exit to windows, i come back after work to find out all my data was gone all my excitement is gone and i don't wanna play it anymore i heard so much good stuff about the game but this just ruins it for me to get that far and have my data corrupted"
3400,6,"the exploration is fine but the combat to this game is fucking dog shit, the color coded shielding thing is so fucking stupid. the dodge and shielding mechanics for your character are fucking redundant, and they made the prompts have no windup on hard, they swarm the shit out of you with enemies in every encounter when this game isnt fucking spiderman. the reason everyone is using the curses is because they literally bypass the retarded shielding mechanic. the story was instantly ""meh"" to me once they introduced ""ancient magic"" and its  literally as generic as u can possibly name something and then they clearly made it as this video gamey ultimate ability that 1 hits shit. i would honestly rather have another story about the phylocipher stone than this shit tbh. theres no quidditch, no daigon alley, no phylocipher stone/Flamel and no founder items (aka the sword of  gryffindor or the diadem of raven claw). admittedly this is very nit picky but the layout of everything in the game is off, gryffindor common room isnt on the moving stairs and forbidden forest isnt by hagreds hut.severely disappointed with this game"
3401,1,Let me play
3402,3,PROTEGO... STUPIFY
3403,2,It's 100X more than I expected and I just started!
3404,16,"This game is just Awesome ,nothing to say. Worth it's money 100%."
3405,18,Your a wizard harry
3406,35,"Loved the story! The graphics are amazing, and the combat is so satisfying!! The game would sometimes freeze for me, and the NPC's behaviour could get buggy...Overall amazing game!!! Hoping for some kind of sequel."
3407,2,3 hours in already in love with the game  game is deff a must play on hard mode anything else is too easy
3408,13,does nerd the greatest service and giving us the full on harry potter experience that we have been waiting for
3409,47,"If you haven't gotten this game, then you wouldn't believe how inconvenient travel was before Floo Powder was invented."
3410,13,"I got lost 20 times while navigating the castle. Yes, that's how big it is. It's worth every penny."
3411,29,"Honestly, this game has blown my mind. It's phenomenal, very few flaws and one of the most fun experiences I've had in forever"
3412,11,I LOVED EVERYTHING!!! Just add Quidditch and Co-Op and it would be the best game of all time.
3413,7,such a great game so far i am having so much fun totally worth the purchase
3414,22,"Fantastic combat, exploration, and more."
3415,10,fix framerate issues! :)
3416,31,"Coolest game I've played this year hands down, definitely GOTY material."
3417,5,A game made for Potterheads
3418,7,CRUCIOOOOOOOOOO
3419,4,"Wizards and magic isn't really my thing, but this is so much better than I expected. Glad I took a chance on it."
3420,8,Lots of magic!  should be optimize better..
3421,15,Wait... You're telling me we have to be.. Bri*ish??? Worst game ever!
3422,13,I came into this game with zero expectations and I'm having a great time. The magic is indeed happening.
3423,19,"Great story line, great game play, great combat and all over nostalgic"
3424,18,Yeah its pre' good.
3425,15,Very fun!
3426,4,im harry potter
3427,9,An absolute must for any Potter Fan
3428,26,A must have game for Harry Potter fans!
3429,14,didn't consume my life at all
3430,2,better then that elden shit
3431,19,"Pros: -The best thing this game has going for it are the visuals. -transmog-nostalgia I guessCons:-the story/ writing is absolute garbage, npc's always have the most asinine commentary imaginable-tons of immersion breaking things are just never addressed, like the fact that the pc is a straight up murder hobo and has incredibly blaze reactions to killing hundreds of people in spite of being a teenage student who supposedly only just found out about being a wizard 2 weeks before the game starts? -the side quests are super repetitive/ boring, most are just fetch or kill quests-everything in the open world is just a handful of copy pasted encounters-the combat has a decent flow but it's undermined by the lack options for building out your character and lack of difficulty, not to mention all the cheesy 1 shot strats (stealth 1h kos almost everything for some reason for example)-npcs often stutter around and glitch out-a number of potentially cool game systems were seemingly added as an afterthought, maybe with mods things like flying mounts, gear upgrades, and crafting could be engaging but in their present state there's barely any reason to bother and some are just frustratingly clunky-the tutorial takes 10 real life years to complete-J.K. Rowling"
3432,21,Lived up to the hype and more
3433,25,Genuinely one of the most interesting and engaging open worlds i've played in years
3434,6,Combat is very fun
3435,6,your a wizard harry
3436,20,wheres Hermione?
3437,12,Great game!
3438,8,Something fresh and new!
3439,31,"Only issue i have had were loading screen times, which is due to my hardware not the game! Everything is beautiful!"
3440,18,I have been at this for 31 hours and I have loved every minute of it! Incredible to explore the entire inside of the school something you don't get from the books or the movies. Can't wait to keep on going!
3441,24,nice gaem 10/10
3442,14,I spent 12 hours finding cats
3443,6,Great game! all my friends love it too
3444,11,heheheyup
3445,30,"Incredible game, when its over big sad. Feeling cute, might obliviate myself later and play it again, idk."
3446,2,It's been really cool so far. Runs well with no bugs so far. Great for any Harry Potter fan. And probably a good experience for any new fans to the world of Harry Potter
3447,15,open sandbox in harry potter land.... fun fun fun.
3448,6,Very fun game.  Runs nicely.  Its so nice to have a game that works when it comes out.  :)
3449,25,"they need to add an update where you can pet and play around with the beasts, 10/10 though"
3450,5,Committed troll genocide. 10/10
3451,9,"15 played in one day, nuff said."
3452,8,I fell threw the map highly reccomend
3453,11,"Literally one of the funnest games that I have ever played! It's amazing, especially since it can be hard to find a good mmorpg game to play. This one out does them all for me. 11/10 recommend."
3454,15,"Fun game, lots of main quests, and even side quests. fun clothes that boost damage, health, etc. Must play!"
3455,28,Obsessed.....
3456,25,"Great game so far, has lived up to the hype! I havent had this much fun or excitement since my first time with the movies!"
3457,37,One word. Obsessed. I loved reading the books and than watching the movies as a kid. This game makes me so happy and makes me feel as if I am actually at Hogwarts.
3458,21,Great immersive experience and (once the updates happened) great visuals!
3459,6,10/10 can pet the cat!
3460,8,Over all really fun and full of Harry Potter lore.
3461,13,"The PC performance is really bad, and they need to work harder to optimize the game (particularly on nvidia gpus), but it's still really fun. Rowling is a PoS obviously but the game is not Rowling, and I'm enjoying it."
3462,4,"only 7 hours into it.  So far flawless and just simply fun.  Running on Ultra and is good eye candy.  Not sure if the keyboard controls will get to be too complicated, lots of spells to be had."
3463,8,"This game is absolutely amazing ! its everything we hoped for and more . If you don't already have this game, i feel sorry for you . go rob a bank , steal your parents money or become a drug dealer , just get the game !"
3464,11,beautiful game worth every cent <3
3465,19,Definitely an awesome game :)
3466,32,Avada kadavara
3467,7,all of it is good
3468,6,love this game
3469,19,"FANTASTIC and sucks you right in.....also, JK Rowling isn't based enough"
3470,24,"Makes me want a REAL LIFE Hogwarts! This game covers so many fun details of the movies and books. If you are a Harry Potter nerd, try this out!"
3471,8,good game 10/10
3472,2,A very intreasting and exciting game i would so recommend to all Harry Potter Fans.  Did amazing job and keeps your attention at all times.
3473,20,Absolutely Fantastic!!!!!!!!!
3474,1,"All in, yes this game hits HARD. I'm in the middle of playing right now. I CAN PET ME A FUCKIN' CAT! 11/10"
3475,8,"The performance issues aside, I""m going to focus on the actual game here. It's a Ubisoft openworld game in a Harry Potter wrapper. The quests are the same and completely forgettable. Instead of collecting 5 books, you'll be collecting 5 stones for the next one. The biggest hindrance being lifeless NPCs. No seriously, NPCs do not respond to you at all. You walk up to them, nothing. You cast a spell on them, nothing. It's as if you are walking through a pensive.  The side characters have zero emotion, it's as if the voice actors are simply reading their lines. The castle is well designed however, lots of attention to detail. The combat has a bit of depth to it and is fun. If a childhood dream is to simply walk through the halls of hogwarts, you'll like it. Do not expect a lively school, cause it ain't that at all."
3476,41,Don't recommend in it's current state
3477,19,BEST GAMES SO FAR
3478,0,Game is boring.
3479,29,Its just a great game enough said.
3480,10,good game
3481,3,Just great!!
3482,18,Great game! No Complaints
3483,19,dawg da spells are something else
3484,8,very pog
3485,8,"The problem starts when you see people ""Recommending"" the Game on Steam but complaining about the performance..We know that the game is amazing, but the poor optimization and the low fps discourage playing, the impression it gives is that Avalanche Software made the game for those who have Playstation 5 or Xbox, for those who have a Nasa PC it was only 1 bonus . .After years waiting for the release of Hogwarts Legacy, this resource-drinking turtle is released. The update that came out on the 14th made it slower, if they improve I'll change this review."
3486,15,fly your broom. catch and sell lil beasties. kill a bunch of people and wondrous beasts. fun for the whole family
3487,18,good game but need fix interactions from students villagers and others
3488,3,Very fun game super immersive
3489,3,Skidadle skidoodle your d**k is now a noodle

3494,3,Such a well made game. Very addicting!
3495,12,Perfect for a harry potter fan.  Makes you feel part of that world.  Challenging but very fun.
3496,16,"If your a fan of the world of wizarding, then this game is for you. It was an amazing open world, loads of quest, and a fantastic story. Seriously cannot put it done. Im like 30 hours in and Im 20 % done with the 100%ing. A MUST BUY!!"
3497,9,immersive....
3498,95,game has a ton of potential. was all around fun worth the buy.
3499,9,good ass gmae
3500,5,Fun & worth it!
3501,36,"don't listen to the negative, its a great game, fun, replay value at least twice, and beautiful game as well."
3502,2,Cant review something that wont run.  Crash crash crash.
3503,7,"It's a great game that i think everyone should try, its fun getting to learn the spells and fly too."
3504,35,it is a slay ass game despite what ppl r sayin abt it x
3505,21,A love letter to HP fans and a damn good Action-Adventure RPG.
3506,23,After all this time? Always.
3507,9,"lost in the story, lost in the challenges, lots to do, mean to only try it for a few hours, which is already +15 hours.... meh few more hours.. lol"
3508,20,AMAZING YES
3509,6,great game
3510,9,"Graphic, story, interactions with the environment and NPC. Just magnificent game"
3511,19,"Amazing game, haven't had this much fun since I was a kid playing Skyrim"
3512,25,"So... I love this game. I really do...But man...The PC performance has been an absolute dumpster fire for me. I keep pushing on due to loving the game. I am starting to go insane...That being said, what a great game in premise. For the love of everything holy, please, pretend to the optimize this game. I have a good CPU and a RTX 2070 Super...I meet requirements. There are 0 reasons this game should run terribly for me.I beg you... please fix it. I will change the review when you do."
3513,7,full time student
3514,4,one of best I played ever
3515,24,I feel gross
3516,29,Very fun game
3517,4,avada kedavra
3518,20,You know when you were a kid and wanted to be in Hogwarts? This is it
3519,15,Professor Garlic and Shadow Wizard Money Gang 
3520,6,shit heat ima wizard harry
3521,47,lives up to the hype. It's not perfect but it is the best game ive played in a long time. the environments are unique and beautiful. plenty of interesting characters. You can really customize and build your own story.
3522,13,great game
3523,20,chamber of secrets remaster 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
3524,27,Combat is amazing and the world is even better.
3525,35,I would def recommend based on sheer amount of things to do that i didnt hate doing.
3526,45,"It's a bit confused, but it's got spirit."
3527,24,Everything I always wanted from a Harry Potter game. So good.
3528,6,great game
3529,14,avada kedabra
3530,19,Game of the year
3531,30,Love this game
3532,7,"The quests, dialogue, and rewards for doing anything were too repetitive, tacked on RPG mechanics that serve no purpose, a severe lack of freedom with spellcasting systems. This game was targeted towards a casual audience that I guess I'm not a part of - I expected more given the rave reviews."
3533,12,You get to do spells n shit 10/10
3534,7,"9/10, wish character customization was better in early game, great game tbh, if you need something to escape reality and havnt been able to find smthn like that recently this game is great. Reminds me of Fable 3 on 360."
3535,43,Don't believe the fake media BS.  Game is easily a top 5 AAA title in the last 5 years.  Easy.
3536,14,"Extremely worth it. The only single way this game can be bad is because you cannot focus on one task without something else interesting catching your attention, In my opinion, a good problem to have."
3537,11,"Seriously one of the most amazing experiences exploring Hogwarts. The castle's design itself is crazy, big props to the map designers + puzzles. I can't even imagine the amount of time & effort it took to make it this awesome!!"
3538,8,"This is what a game should be when it is released. Gorgeous, well thought out, in depth, and nearly bug free in my experience."
3539,11,Good Game.
3540,13,finally a world that i really wanted to explore
3541,22,Worth every bucks
3542,2,"Looks like a good game but unplayable at its current state with all the stuttering, maybe buy when it's on sale"
3543,19,"8.7/10need at least 16 gb ram to play with any sort of immersion, you can pet cats, lots of spells, fuck goblins"
3544,9,Game has crashed on me at least 15 times and I've only played like 14 hours.
3545,35,This game is great. It released in a playable state and commits to the world. More proof that single player games aren't dead.
3546,17,"Well, who doesn't want to relive their childhood fantasy. Overall really nice game though it needs some work because of fps drops and glitches....but other than that, u surely will enjoy this."
3547,34,"I am 9 years old again, lost in a world of awe and wonder. I finally got my hogwarts letter."
3548,24,Just what I needed.
3549,6,"This game is so stunning! The story line is amazing. Even when I'm not focused on the story line, there are plenty of other things to get done, puzzles, side quest, collecting. LOVE LOVE LOVE"
3550,2,good game
3551,8,AVADA KEDAVRA
3552,2,Games fucking mint boys.
3553,9,You have to be Br*tish.
3554,1,Better than I could have ever imagined. Holds true to book lore.
3555,2,fix this horrid optimization for pc. 
3556,5,amazing game absolutely outstanding
3557,22,"It is like they took those old Harry Potter games for Gameboy and Playstation 1 and smashed them into the world of Skyrim. Super fun, very well done, 10/10, I would buy again."
3558,15,Best game i bought on 2023
3559,13,Amazbawls
3560,12,love it..
3561,2,"Very fun , so much to do"
3562,20,epic trans character gottem
3563,1,Fun to see all the iconic locations
3564,31,Everything we've been waiting for.  Holding out hope for an MMO.
3565,9,All the spells!
3566,12,"Amazing game, its  a must play."
3567,14,Awesome and magical!
3568,15,this game is so much fun
3569,4,I truly love the game :)
3570,13,i giga recommend
3571,11,Welcome to Hogwarts... Not much more to say other than it really feels like you're going through the actual sets of the castle. Been waiting on this game for too long. Well worth the money 15/10.
3572,7,"Movies are ass, but game is fantastic"
3573,2,peak fiction
3574,21,I am very satisfied with this game.  I will be satisfied again if this game is immediately fixed for stuttering and lag problems.  it happened around hogwarts castle and hogsmeade.
3575,9,AH MAAAYzing
3576,18,"Awesome game i loved it. besides constant frame rate drops making this unplayable on my machine i have a rtx 2080 ti well above the recommened and it cant even keep up on medium settings. even after this most recent update that the Patch notes stated that they ""fixed"" its just as bad if not worse my steam deck plays it flawlessly DO NOT BUY TILL THEY RESOLVE THE ISSUES WITH NVIDIA unless you have amd then play till your hearts content"
3577,10,"Great game in DIRE need of an update. Seriously, spending all that time on making such an amazing game, why would you make such a sloppy port?"
3578,3,"cool. magic good, combat amazing"
3579,27,So FuNI!
3580,16,"Amazing Game - story line, side quest and everything!! I do like the exploration aspect of the world of Harry Potter!! I always lose myself just going to different sections of Hogwarts and beyond!"
3581,12,Harry Potter game good. Hogwarts haters bad...BAD!
3582,13,"You can be a wizardYou can tame animalYou can build your own room/houseYou can decide your own fashionYou can fly everywhereYou can curse your enemiesand you can bully some jerks or nerds and threat them for money, 10/10!"
3583,9,All roads lead to Hogsmeade
3584,37,Marvellous
3585,18,"More like HogSHIT Legacy, nothing good to say about this game, this is why gaming has gown down hill. Positive reviews on an absolute dogshit game, horrible optimization, planned DLC. What is wrong with you normie fucking retards? Go play candy crush and battle royal, stop positiviely reviewing objectively terrible games. These companis are laughing at you. Let the lgbtq WEIRDO community have it, you deserve eachother."
3586,29,Best game. 10/10 :]
3587,6,"fun game, except it is an arachnophobe's worst nightmare :(((((("
3588,10,"the quests, the mystery, etc."
3589,2,im gonna bust
3590,8,Thoroughly enjoyable game.
3591,16,"Whether you are a Harry Potter fan or just someone who likes RPG's, this game has a large open map with many quests and objectives, or the ability to explore, to keep you busy and wanting to play more!"
3592,67,GOTY Already!!!
3593,6,1- The game is great 10/10 (If only there were no transgender characters) -_- 2- The Arabic language is also excellent in the game3- We are waiting for the second part of it
3594,18,I found a spell that got me a gf 10/10 game would play again
3595,2,just love it
3596,3,Its awesome! Some performance could be improved when transitioning between areas of the map.
3597,8,Best wizard game out there
3598,5,"Really awesome. Love it.  Beautiful in 4K HDR, I don't even really use the fast travel system because everything is so beautiful."
3599,14,"Never cared much for Harry Potter, but I've always loved open word games. This game made me care more about the universe than any of the movies I've seen, and I've had an absolute blast playing it. Must have for people who like open world games."
3600,3,Fun game The Crashing when I try to play is making me angry as fuck
3601,6,Really good
3602,3,Almost everything I've ever wanted in Wizarding World game. Feels like home.
3603,41,"Very good game, not regretting buying Digital Deluxe edition. Was hoping for a game like this to come out at some point since last movie came out in mid 2011, and it was worth the wait."
3604,13,"My wife is big into the Harry Potter Universe. After a few hours watching her play, I decided to buy it. Still needs a PC patch, but with some adjustments, runs great on my 3080. The pacing is fantastic, and addictive."
3605,3,"Really fun and immersive experience, especially for all of us HP raised millenials! Definitely worth getting if you are into a bit of world exploring and magic slingin!"
3606,24,i'm addicted
3607,6,Super fun and clever
3608,3,nice cock
3609,12,"Such an amazing game, only 20 hours in and I havent unlocked half the content yet. The graphics are a bit wonky sometimes but the actual gameplay is fantastic"
3610,6,"Incredible game! Thank you Avalanche Software, you've absolutely nailed this game. Just smooth out the performance and it's an easy 10/10"
3611,23,This game slaps tits
3612,51,"Great looking game with a large open world, loads of content/quests, and fun combat mechanics."
3613,9,easily one of the best games of 2023
3614,17,Very Fun and graphics are amazing
3615,23,Very entertaining so far. I think it could use more optimization for PC.  Seems to want ridiculous hardware to run well on PC with higher graphic settings.
3616,21,9/10 Lots of Performance issues at the moment
3617,19,"It's leviOsa, not levioSA!"
3618,15,It's just good.
3619,12,"Great game play. A well done game. Runs great. Looks great. Crafting, enchantments, etc."
3620,16,"why are there no heavy people in this game i see no larger students whether it be a female male or fluid. in my opinion based on the values of J.K i think maybe this was a planned feature to alienate a second type of person. bad enough that there is no Fluid gender option, you also now cant change you size in game and have to be some skinny kid not a time accurate fatty"
3621,18,Avada Kedavra
3622,3,Amazing game! The graphics and game play are so good and the story-line is intriguing. I would recommend to all Harry Potter fans!
3623,19,Absolutely incredible game
3624,15,Easily one of the best games I have played in a long while. Has it's moments to criticize but overall there is a heavy load of nostalgia and fun that out weigh that. 10/10 would play twice
3625,4,Lots of places to explore and side quests to follow. Having knowledge of the Harry Potter series is not required to enjoy the game.
3626,21,"After about 35 hours I'm 50% through the story, and just bored out of my mind.  The game has great graphics, music, atmosphere, etc.  But after a while the game-play just becomes very mundane.  I doubt I'll finish it."
3627,5,Fuck Twitter this game is pretty good
3628,28,very good game. only complaints are walking through npcs and not being able to jump over railings:)
3629,24,"Good, except the fucking moons to unlock doors"
3630,4,"HAVE YOU EVER WANTED TO PLAY SOMETHING THAT YOU SAW ON TV AND IN THE MOVIES THEATERS AND NOW ON HBO MAX, THIS IS SO FOR YOU, YOULL LOVE THIS THING, BUY IT, USE EVERY PENNY YOU OWN TO PLAY IT, and then realize it doesnt have qudditich yet."
3631,4,so far having a blast love everything about it =]
3632,17,"The game is awesome, loved it so far. The story, the graphics, the game play, damn even the goofy dialogue is good.On the down side i wish there where more mounts in the game, otherwise I very much recommend this game.9/10"
3633,23,Poop turds
3634,0,"Never read a Harry Potter book, Never saw any of the movies. Twitter told me not to play it so I played it."
3635,4,Just a wonderful and fantastic adventure!
3636,23,Excellent depiction of the wizarding world! So beautiful and very interactive!
3637,4,SHADOW WIZARD MONEY GANG WE LOVE CASTING SPELLS
3638,24,I love this game! There is so much to do and everything you do is fun :) good job! Best bday gift I have ever got :D
3639,24,Truly a great game no complaints here i hope there is dlc with more quests and maybe spell unlocks idk maybe thats too much but regardless its an amazing game
3640,20,You can tame beasts and there are rare shineys you can get.
3641,12,Its good but not a great RPG. No decisions have real impacts and gives you a mass effect ending. good chance you will have fun playing the game however.
3642,25,"*Encounter high level troll, barely do damage AVADA KEDAVRA! Another one bites the dust"
3643,22,10/10 would recommendIt's like Skyrim and Elden Ring had a baby. Then one night a dark wizard broke into their house and killed them. the dark wizard tried to kill the baby but failed. That baby is Hogwarts: Legacy.
3644,13,If you like Lego Harry Potter this game is for you.
3645,5,Very enjoyable so far. Doesn't take many risks with game mechanics but the world is very detailed and the story is interesting.
3646,31,Just know that you wont be free flying in the game . Some of the puzzles could give more guidance.
3647,7,i be casting spells and shi
3648,21,This is the most amazing game I've ever played. I've waited my whole life for this.
3649,14,"Absolutely love this game. Clocked close to 16 hours in less than 2 days and was engaged, having fun, the whole time. Looks great, lots to do, runs relatively well, I definitely recommend."
3650,9,So much to do!!!! ADHD has me bouncing everywhere......Squirrel.....eww shiny.....oh whats this.....Spin the globe.......spin spin spin ahahahahahahahah!
3651,18,amazing.
3652,6,:) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
3653,34,incredible. amazing. show stopping. *clap clap
3654,61,"If they allow you to disable gameplay hints for puzzles, I will gladly change this. I'm tired of having every puzzle in the game spoiled because this game only wants to give you 5 seconds to solve it."
3655,16,I LIKE MAGIC WANDS
3656,11,Wow. Dream come true. Amazing game 11 hours of playtime in
3657,22,Great game! they did an amazing job on it for anyone that has a dream of being a badass wizard trying to slaughter people...

3663,24,"I boot up the game so I can look at Mommy Mirab--I mean, attend Professor Garlick's lectures..."
3664,18,Fantastic game all around.

3669,24,Good Game

3671,10,Do not buy this game. This game wont let you be a evil wizard. Rated T for sofTys only buy  this. Horrible main story line. This game is for people who get offended by  gender.
3672,5,This is an amazing game! I have only played for a few hours on it and so far it is living up to the hype!
3673,16,"Beautiful, Fun, Extensive! An Outstanding game and Scratches a Potter Fans Itch!"

3692,30,best game everrrr
3693,27,"Potter Gold - Intricate weaving of the Rowling universe.  The artwork alone, Or even just to wander around hogwarts and take in the magic.  Great value for potter fans.  Gave me a dungeons and dragons feel."
3694,12,"Combat is rewarding and fun, but it is a it slow to get to the point where you can be in constant action."
3695,10,Hogwarts legacy is open world and has many side quests
3696,11,very good
3697,23,Seriously fun gameplay.  Running ultra settings on a 3080 with ray tracing turned off.  The game still looks amazing.  I was getting some pretty heavy drops with ray tracing on.
3698,37,"crucio, attack, attack, attack, attack, avada kedavra"

3738,3,yer a rizzard 'arry
3739,40,"i would of easily payed 100$ for this, what a gem this was/is. 15/10 would go to herbology on time. This with ease takes GOTY and its only February. Story 9/10 Combat 10/10 Looks 10/10"
3740,2,It's a lot of fun even more so if you love harry potter!
3741,3,pretty fun tbh
3742,16,"Really impressed, amazing game!"
3743,22,Without mods it was really badly performing. But thanks to mods it is now sparkling and beautiful. A fun and fantastical game.
3744,16,"binge watched the harry potter movies for this game and it was worth it. the game is amazing, very immersive and great attention to detail."

3754,36,good game
3755,28,its good
3756,4,"Absolutely amazing game. It makes me so happy. The castle, the landscape, and the gear are so beautiful."
3757,24,Game kept auto locking onto the final boss while fighting causing me to not be able hit his orbs so I could do actually do damage. Also since I was stuck locked on to him at the last part of the fight I kept dodging and because my guys was locked on facing forward I could only move forward right into the boss so then he'd kill me. I have lock on unbounded and it still locks on and makes not be able move around freely.
3758,1,Just wow
3759,3,hahhaahhahaahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahaha
3760,15,This game is absolutely fantastic.  Massively enjoyable for both Potter fans and non-fans alike.  SO much content to see and do that makes this game worth the purchase regardless of which version you buy.  10/10 would recommend!
3761,4,"Great Game, Love the open world"
3762,11,graphics are amazing really feels like i got my hogwarts letter i wanted so bad as a kid

3766,4,"Great game, poor optimization for the game, hope we get a new patch soon :("
3767,14,It's been a while since I had a favorite game other than RDR2.. completely IN LOVE !
3768,14,"very fun open world, especially if you like the Harry Potter world."
3769,6,You get to be a wizard... what else could you want?The combat is really fun mix of counters and spamming. Highly recommend.
3770,16,Very fun and creative.
3771,31,"a masterpiece of a game. I wish I could play it again for the first time, it felt like watching the Harry Potter movies for the first time- totally surreal. If youre thinking about getting this game pls just do it, its worth every penny"
3772,50,Fantastic open world game! I'm not a Harry Potter super fan and still really enjoyed the time I've played.
3773,7,games fun
3774,18,"This game is beautiful. I love how I'm enjoying it and when I don't think it can get better it does. It may feel a little slow or maybe overwhelming at first but once you get into it, It keeps me wanting for more."
3775,2,Amazing.
3776,22,wizard vrrrroom awamba awambam bangoon
3777,25,I love the open world aspect and the diverse characters

3779,14,THIS IS DEF GAME OF THE YEAR
3780,31,genuinely enjoyed the experience felt like what I have longed for in a wizarding game since I was a kid
3781,2,"I thought this was a vet simulator for pig husbandry. Since I received it as a gift, I guess I'll give it a go."
3782,12,best game ever. i swear i am a real wizard now. I started carrying a wand around now my wife makes me sleep on the couch. the only time i get close to her anymore is when i cast my invisibility spell but im still detectable.
3783,5,Great game
3784,16,"Holy mother of God what a game... other game developers, take notes. This is how it is done."
3785,24,WHHAAAAAA WIZARD LANMD YEWAH
3786,19,"It's a good game and all, just poorly optimized for pc. Also the devs lazily put a mans voice over the tavern woman, so the game is kinda rushed as well. I can't recommend a game where it breaks immersion putting the wrong gender's voice over a npc, it just sounds horrible and looks uncanny."
3787,22,i can crucio
3788,19,Exasperatingly easily exceeds every expectation.
3789,2,"Very well done, great animation, great story"
3790,9,"everything you need in a fantasy adventure, great battle, great story, always somethig cool to see, fluent, open, goodness, i cannot stop playing!"
3791,65,"Just don´t! Shallow, empty, no brain needed. Wasted opportunity at best."
3792,26,This game is amazing. That is all you need to know.
3793,33,GOTY material
3794,16,Good gameplay
3795,17,Do you enjoy playing a game and next thing you know the sun is coming up outside? Then this is the game for you
3796,7,if you love Harry Potter universe-this is the game for you..very enjoyable!
3797,13,really fun but is missing sex:/
3798,6,This game is just awesome. Playing it with my girlfriend and we're having a blast! love it!
3799,4,"Can't give it a thumbs up until they fix the performance. Stuttering like crazy while in combat or just strutting around hogwarts. One second Im getting 144 fps and then WHAM, Im down to 20. Sometimes I can't lock onto enemies or the lock on indication just disappears. Once they can fix these issues this would be a fun game to play but right now I just frustrating. I would get a refund if I honestly could"
3800,19,"Pretty good game a good range of free roam and an excellent story so far. Kind of disappointed that you cant land on the castle roofs and stuff like that, but it makes sense. Overall a great game and one I recommend to anyone who likes the HP universe."
3801,6,herbology teachar is supear hot
3802,5,"If i were to rate this game on it's story and game play only i would say it is great. But sadly as good as the game play and story of this game is for what i have been through the performance is so bad in areas of the game like when in the castle or the small town that is near by seriously takes away from the enjoyment of the game. When you go from 100+ fps all the way down to 80-30 fps it hurts...I think the worst for me is the stuttering that happens, it is so hard on my eyes like yikes....I really hope this gets sorted out soon because i truly think this would be such a fun game to play if it was smooth all the time. I would highly recommend waiting to get this game on PC till a fix is made for the performance problems. I just want to make clear the only reason i am giving this a bad ratting is based on the bad performance. My PC specs belowGPU: 3080CPU: i7 8700RAM: 32 Gigs"
3803,16,Great game
3804,10,Great game. A little buggy in places but extremely immersive.
3805,8,incredibly fun and nostalgic
3806,8,didn't disappoint
3807,20,"I said I would buy this for my sister, but 30+ hours later, I realized I bought it for me."
3808,7,dobby's sock
3809,5,it may not run very well all the time but it more polished than any other game that came out in the last year
3810,15,If you are Harry Potter/Wizarding World Fan this game Rocks!!!!
3811,8,"You can do everything you can't do in real life, like casting magic and talking to girls"
3812,32,"Beasts, potions, plants, spells, 3D map, flying, cinimatic cutscenes, this game is too good. Like u need it all but it isnt a strain its just flippin harry potter type stuff."
3813,6,YOU'RE A WIZARD.... NEED I SAY MORE?
3814,21,Amazing !!
3815,36,this is a good game would suggest besides THE FING FRAME RATE LAG
3816,6,Boring open world trope filled game with a Harry Potter skin. Combat is okay I guess
3817,6,british people
3818,10,Best harry potter world game ever.
3819,82,The goblins control the banks and the media.
3820,3,A lot of content.
3821,21,I'm engrossed. I haven't played anything like it. I LOVE IT.
3822,10,Can't kill the other students. So can't prep for my trip to America. Sad
3823,29,"Game Banging icl even my doggy pc can run it, lore is top tier"

3828,7,wooooohoooooo
3829,7,Its great. Going to win game of the year. The new standard for games
3830,1,"This game says I played 2.2 hours. WRONG. That's me trying to get the damn thing past shaders.Hopefully there will be a fix. I cannot get the damn thing to run, and cannot return as didn't buy on Steam."
3831,17,10y/o me would have absolutely lost his shit if he had seen this back when
3832,15,This game makes me depulso in my seat for hours. Thank you
3833,14,"Fun story but boring side quests. Also, it takes WAY too long into the story to learn curses. By the time you learn Avada Kedavra, you're at the end of the game. Other than that, fun game and looks amazing. Lots of graphical errors though."
3834,33,"PC user here that hasn't seen all the movies or read any of the books...plug in an xbox controller, turn on the ray tracing, and ABSOLUTELY LOSE YOURSELF.  10/10"
3835,23,Game is amazing there is a lot of content and this game was released not broken which should be a norm but it is rare now sadly.  Story and side missions are awesome so many things to explore and do.  I highly recommend it
3836,20,AAAVVVVAAADAAAA KADDDABBBRRRAAAAAAA!!!!!

3840,8,very well!!!
3841,28,Its like being a wizard but you dont have to be a virgin
3842,24,Solid game. Well made. A lot of things to do and collect.
3843,24,This game is one of the best for graphics and story line. I recommend this game to anyone if they like playing a game with magic and stories from Harry Potter and to live in a different world other than our own! It's a game to have fun and explore!
3844,9,"Pretty solid gameplay and story, I just wish it were optimized a little bit better for PC, but in due time.  All in all, I'm still having a blast being a WIZARD!"
3845,23,a true AAA experience
3846,19,It's my favorite game
3847,62,Definitely A Game of this Year
3848,18,AVADA KEDAVRA
3849,43,"Nice combat, good lore shame about some of the open world tropes but well worth playing."
3850,7,"i love the game and the orchestra score in the background is perfect and synonymous to the movies, it takes you back to the good ol days. graphics are top notch and spell usage is good too.But the game is pretty easy even on hardest difficulty"
3851,11,"Great storyline, nice combat mechanics, nice map, good mission progression"
3852,4,So AWESOME! The Quests are spell bounding. Graphics are SWEET!
3853,18,Honestly? Best game i've played in like 10 years.
3854,20,not the best open world game but since i love harry potter i had alot of fun im gonna try getting all the endings. be warned if you chose to go the dark arts route you literally kill and watch so many good ppl die its so sad
3855,20,"very good story, cool creatures, fun spells, and awesome flying opportunities"
3856,25,It's great
3857,27,"Awesome game, must play."
3858,4,idc about jk rowling writing but love her politics
3859,12,"Amazing Game and just astounded how much open world is really out there for Hogwarts, lots to explore"
3860,32,The Geneva convention?More like Geneva suggestion...AVADA KEDAVRA!10/10 would murder with unforgivable curses again
3861,1,Bought 2 copies because I am a terrible person.In all seriousness this is the Harry Potter game we were owed back on ps2.
3862,15,"Wherever you and Sebastian go, Ominis will find you."
3863,23,"Outstanding, I have no words it is an amazing game"
3864,10,this is a very cute and fun game
3865,20,"This game is amazing, it has its bugs but it will get patched sooner or later."

3871,15,#NAME?
3872,43,Amazing collectathon set in the wizarding world. Tons to do and a huge world to explore. HP fans will be very pleased with the attention to detail in this game. Combat is smooth and fun. Great step into the harry potter universe hope there is more to come!
3873,30,"I generally like the game, but it doesn't feel like an open world RPG.  I just wish it had more RPG elements and decisions mattered more."
3874,42,"Look at this new spell I learnt, CRUCIO!"
3875,19,Can't stop playing! It's like Skyrim/Witcher 3 but in a perfect Harry Potter World! A secret and surprise around every corner. Superb 10/10!
3876,23,Best HP game
3877,13,"If you ever wanted to enroll into Hogwarts as you read and saw Harry Potter, I highly recommend this game. Trust me it is worth it."
3878,17,Amazing fun for any Harry Potter fan!
3879,3,too much talking
3880,0,it's good but you should have a good computer
3881,3,"Game is amazing, no complaints."
3882,2,Yet another Developer that thinks it's alright to release a poorly optimized game for PC. Honestly so sick and tired of greedy companies releasing an unplayable game. Its been 5 days since official release fix the god damn game already and keep us up to date on what's going on
3883,6,"Truly an amazing game, if it wasn't for everyone being childish and idiotic about this game upon release id say it could be nominated for best game of the year."
3884,16,"yes very good, must buy"
3885,12,still havent learned any curses 10/10 would recommend
3886,16,This game is perfect for anyone that loves the world of Harry Potter while not playing any of the characters of Harry Potter.
3887,8,"Love this game, I would recommend this to anyone who is fan of open world games/ RPGs."
3888,3,Very Based Game :)
3889,6,good game

3893,11,It's a great rpg and it always keeps me engaged.
3894,37,"game is fun, some bugs, but mostly spiders."
3895,18,Garlick my nuts
3896,18,The most fun i've had on a game for a very long time.
3897,6,it's cool
3898,5,Got this for my 13 year old to play but now I look forward to him going to bed at night so I can play. Great quests to follow and a fun story line.
3899,6,a little buggy here and there but overall i barely noticed and the game so far is amazing
3900,7,Anyone who enjoys the Harry Potter movie franchise or the books will enjoy the nostalgia and wonder this game curates. You can tell many details were carefully and thoughtfully executed and it makes for a great experience.
3901,13,Graphics are intense.  Having a blast playing along side my daughter
3902,2,"Super immersive, and the atmosphere is charismatic! Even though within my few hours of the game the quest often feel a bit generic but combat is fluid and fun and thoroughly unique."
3903,6,At minimum requirements (my system is old) it still runs just fine.  No lag at all.  The game is fun.  Lots of puzzles and exploring a place that we all would love to do in real life.  5 out of 5 stars.  Highly recommend!
3904,4,"Not the harry potter story I was looking for as its a bit meh, but the combat is great as I feel its a cross between souls like and smash bros a bit"
3905,16,CONFRINGO
3906,12,amazing 10/10 hope story continues chronologically
3907,22,"Honestly. One of the best games I have put time into as of late. great game play, lot's to do. tons of mystery. Witcher vibes heavily."
3908,6,"Great game. Visually Stunning. Only had one problem, I walked out into a new area of Hogwarts and opened and closed the menu quickly which caused the game to un-render the area I was in, causing me to fall through the map. Other than that amazing story, 10/10"
3909,5,"So far, this is extremely well done. The game does a great job of making you feel immersed and the world is beautifully crafted. There are some hiccups, especially with optimization in some areas, but nothing that ruins the overall game."
3910,3,yea its good
3911,20,i love magik
3912,3,magik out of stik
3913,2,best single player in a while :)wasnt expecting much but im totally blown away :)
3914,35,Story is good but not great. Gear could be more in-depth but its not a hindrance to game play. Must buy if you are a Harry Potter fan. Screw the controversy about the author.
3915,20,10/10 its a great game everything you want plus
3916,6,GOOD GAME
3917,31,It's pretty much exactly what they said it would be.
3918,7,Legalize Nuclear Wands
3919,29,"Solid 8/10, brings back the childhood memories! Waiting for some DLC's and hopefully co-op and quidditch but we'll see."
3920,19,i have greatly enjoyed this game. truly a magical experience to be able to explore Hogwarts. amazing job by the developers!
3921,2,Don't typically play single player games but this ticks all of the boxes. Awesome game.
3922,3,"UI/UX sucks and some things are wonky like being forced to walk slow in certain areas, but it does pretty much every thing else right"
3923,16,thumbs up
3924,13,Great game! Its like Skyrim in the Harry Potter universe! Harry your a wizard! 
3925,7,"Quest as you please while flying/wondering the woods killing poachers with magic. Basic Single Player game, Cant wait for DLCs and Mods."
3926,8,Fun Game
3927,15,The game is good although it does take some time to really fly or anything and its very easy to get distracted and caught up into other quests in the game. sometimes its a bit too disorganized.
3928,27,Most fun I've had with a game in a while. Does a lot of things right but feels like it could use a bit more substance. Jack of all trades Master of none kinda vibes
3929,2,"The game starts you off in an introduction area which is simply put the tutorial stage of the game. After this, you are taken to hogwarts, where you are immediately met with terrible framerates and clearly a poorly optimised game for PC'S. I have a 3070 Ti, and was having framerate issues even on medium settings which, comparatively to RDR2, I can get ultra high with no issues. In this current state of the game, I would not recommend it if you are looking for a smooth gameplay experience. I have gotten a refund and will not be playing until the devs can sort our this poor optimisation issue."

3937,33,"Dont usually review, but compelled to review because of how good is this"
3938,24,"This is a really good game, i'm enjoing it a lot. :) I hope we can have multiplayer some day."
3939,35,very sexy

3946,22,"After no man Sky, I stop doing pre-orders.  However, I've never watched a Harry Potter movie but I pre-ordered this a week before launch.  This game is The Witcher 3, Skyrim, Oblivion, Bully and AC: Origins all in one."

3982,18,Combat is really fun and the story is engaging.
3983,20,"great game, tons to do"
3984,2,*Insert Voldemort memes here* If you can get past all the controversy the game is really well done and well made. Def play it if you are on the fence
3985,18,Actually pretty fun grew up reading the books and this is great
3986,9,"Went to the midnight releases of books since Sorcerers stone,  I've been waiting on this game for damn near my entire life. It delivers in every way.  I cant wait to see what else Legacy has in store"

3992,5,One of the best game you will ever experience with !! The game quality is insane and you will fall in to the magic world once you played the game :D
3993,6,pretty good. one of the better open world games ive played in years and the combat is fun too.
3994,23,So glad I bought this game. It really fits with my ideology! I love wizards!
3995,1,great game
3996,5,duuude what a great time for pc!
3997,12,Very well made game. Met the expectation and more! But unfortunatelly poorely optimized. Hope to get a performance update soon!
3998,35,stop worrying about all the woke people crapping on the game and JUST PLAY THE GAME ITS MAGICAL
3999,5,"Wonderful game, really makes you want to go and explore."
4000,6,good game if you're just Harry
4001,2,"Pretty good so far, it's like a movie."
4002,9,"Bruh. How is this so good? I'm not even a big Harry Potter fan, but if you like RPG games of ANY sort, you will love this game. It is the perfection of the RPG genre."
4003,19,You know you want it
4004,5,"I've been wondering for years why nobody has come out with this game. Finally they did, and it doesn't disappoint. This one is like a book that you can't put down."
4005,2,"Great game, although I would love it to require less Ram as it eats a lot of it even with the lowest settings.I really do not know how they will manage to implement in onto switch,I recommend the game its really good in terms of story-line and PVE."
4006,10,"It's fun. graphics are beautiful, and there's lots to do."
4007,14,"You can do everything you can't do in real life, like casting magic and talking to girls"
4008,24,"The game is beautiful. There is a good mix of story line and adventure. The controls for flying are a bit wonky, I think it would be nice if the broom controls were separate from the mount controls."
4009,24,Good gameplay good graphics if you like harry potter youll love it
4010,2,goated with da sauce
4011,46,"The excellent Hogwarts game we all wanted. Really makes you feel a part of this world. The typical open world mechanics won't cater to every player, but the phenomenal world building and little details carry the experience. 9/10"
4012,10,"Like going on a date with someone extremely attractive with absolutely no interests or anything to talk about, Hogwarts legacy has both gameplay and characters that are extremely shallow. At 16 hours in, it feels similar to being halfway through season 2 of a Netflix series and waiting for it to get good enough to justify the time I've spent. None of the characters are worth remembering and the plot tries extremely hard to be convoluted. Even on the hardest difficulty, the combat boils down to staring at your character to dodge when your character lights up (indicating you're about to be hit) and then button mashing.If you're a fan of beautiful graphics and a diehard Harry Potter fan, this game may be for you. Otherwise, if you're looking for an engaging story and deep/immersive gameplay, stay away."
4013,30,Avada kadavra
4014,8,I usually don't write reviews but had to here so I pre ordered this and gameplay is great played it for 2 days.  tried to play it again and now it's not launching the game for me at all all my drivers everything is up to date deleted the folder and everything still won't load. which is why I have to get refund on it
4015,27,Beautiful game very nostalgic !
4016,2,Are you looking for a spell to speed up time and lose it at the same time?PLAY THIS GAME
4017,20,great game!
4018,9,Do I really need to say why you should play this? Just do it..
4019,27,I may have played this a lot - but I’m still extremely dissapointed. This game has absolutely zero depth.
4020,2,Bought it just to spite the sjw's and T's...turns out its actually a good game!
4021,5,great game
4022,36,hog dick cock dick
4023,12,A good chill game that is well developed and has a lot to offer to all gamers.
4024,6,"Really good game, Takes awhile to beat but fun to play. One stupid thing is you never drink butter beer which automatically ruined the game for me. Please add butter beer. Only buy the game when they allow you to buy and drink butter beer"
4025,2,Wish I can cast repario on this game and make it run better
4026,16,very good
4027,18,Sucks you right into the world. I have really enjoyed the game.
4028,8,I can't recommend the game until they fix performance issues of stuttering and crashing. I'll update my review once they patch it.
4029,20,great game worth the try
4030,5,"Fun game, couple opportunities:  no morality system, no quidditch and unclear backstory on how the 5th year student ended up at Hogwarts."
4031,16,Entertaining
4032,24,Awesome so much fun. I can explore the world for hours  finding little details
4033,21,It's like a solid 8/10 game. If you are super big on the settings like world maybe a 9/10
4034,15,10/10 with mods the game will only get better
4035,33,It's a beautiful game and I love flying around and interacting with the Beats. They're adorable
4036,3,Yes i recommend this game to anyone who would like to tell cancel culture to fuck off...
4037,14,"Never watched a Harry Potter film or read any of the books. Love this game. Masterpiece. Reminds me of Fable but like, a much better fable than fable."
4038,36,It is a wonderful and captivating open world game for both Harry Potter fans and non fans.
4039,8,As a Harry Potter fan since 3 years old i`m sobbing
4040,6,Open world at Hogwarts! What more do you need millennials?
4041,7,It has so many fun experiences.
4042,15,i got avada kedavra very great
4043,38,"As great as the main story and most ""relationship line"" major side stories are, the world is utterly empty for the most part, there is ZERO ""I'm a student at Hogwarts"" gameplay outside of 1 or 2 short cutscenes per class, that's it.Your choice of house doesn't matter one bit, your dialogue and behaviour choices are always the exact same no matter if you're Slytherin or Hufflepuff.Using the Dark Arts? No one cares... you can literally cast Avada Kedavra right IN FRONT of your professors, and they do not even react, let alone cause you any consequences whatsoever.Hogwarts itself, while visually impressive to be sure, has zero point zero percent ""Sentient Castle"" feel... nothing... there aren't even the iconic moving staircases... they only fade in and out visually, but they are nonetheless 100% static, always connecting the same point A to the same point B.Room of Requirement also is a major letdown, as it has zero roleplaying value, it is simply a room full of resource nodes, and the Vivaria are just the same... sure, for a few minutes it might be nice to watch a Hippogriff young offspring frolick about, but that's all you're getting... the animals themselves are also just glorified resource nodes, all you can do is brush, feed, harvest, repeat ad nauseam.The stuff you can summon both in RoR and Vivaria is also just scene dressing... if you were thinking of actually entering that Cottage you spawned in your Vivarium, think again.... if you thought you could sit down on those comfy chairs you just summoned, think again.Same with everything outside of the RoR as well... think you could go to the Great Hall, sit down at your House Table and eat, interact with friends/NPCs of your house, etc? Think again.The few things Hogwarts Legacy does well, it does really well... but everything else, and especially the ending of the main story, where your choices make zero difference, with there not even being any Epilogue to speak of... it all feels very rushed, and the game pretty much in all aspects aside from Main and ""Relationship Line"" story fails utterly to live up to the potential that is there in abundance.On top of all that, there's the abysmal technical state affecting a huge number of players even on 4090-level gaming rigs, and the fact that the game is massively shorter than what the devs promised... if I hadn't gotten it for free, I would've honestly refunded it, or otherwise felt majorly taken for a ride.Given that the game puts our ""Legacy"" so front and center, there's very little communication thereof while you play the game... for the most part, there are literally ZERO consequences to your actions, it simply doesn't matter what you do or don't do, if you use the Unforgivable Curses or not, not even what you decide during the crucial final minutes of the story... and as I said above, there isn't even any proper Epilogue, nothing to actually show you how your choices changed the world around you, i.e. what your ""Legacy"" actually would be.Nothing at all. And that leaves a decidedly bitter aftertaste... so much wasted potential... this game could have been a true masterpiece... as it stands, I cannot in good conscience recommend it for full price."
4044,5,i likr the wands

4197,8,World Design
4198,24,15/10 amazing game
4199,24,"If you're not a fan of Harry Potter, this game doesn't really have anything new and fun to add to the table. The game seemed to be marketed as some sort of RPG, but it has incredibly little in the way of good actual RPG elements (like a compelling story with choices that affect it). There are lots of side quests of different sorts of puzzles, but there are tons and tons of them. The map is quite big and scenic, but it's all rather repetitive- for example, there are probably 15-20 villages, but there is very little to distinguish them. Also, as far as side characters, they completely disappear from the game once you've done their side quest. It would be nice if there were more activities to do with the characters that are supposed to be your friend, but there are almost none. Also, I'll be the millionth person to say that a Harry Potter game not having quidditch is one of the biggest misses imaginable. Growing up as a huge fan of Harry Potter, it was basically my favorite thing to imagine myself doing. They put a lot more effort into a system of growing plants, making potions, and tending to animals. The animal system is very in depth, but not terribly exciting as far as Harry Potter goes. Wouldn't it make more sense to find the animals, catalog them, rather than capture them and keep them in your pen? The combat system was heavily criticized online, but I think it's one of the thing about the game that was done quite well. I think once you learn a few spells, it gets quite fun. The dodging can be a little clunky, but the comboing feels very fluid and interesting. Some of the criticisms about the antisemitism in the story seem a little sensationalized, but I definitely think there are several elements to the story that are amiss (the bad guys are fighting for... equality?) sometimes once your character clears out a Goblin camp, they will say something like ""It's too late for you to change your ways!"" which sounds a little dark, and doesn't help the games image. On the plus side, at least, the inclusion of Sirona Ryan is a nice touch. It's a nice gesture by the game creators to have a transgender character who is an important part of the story, and an interesting character to boot. Still, I can't get it out of my head that one of the goblins says, ""I agree with you, violence isn't the answer!"" to the leader of the goblins, which is an incredibly milquetoast, neoliberal vision of the world. I suppose that fits with JK Rowling's style, much to the detriment of this game. Like I said, if you're a Harry Potter fan, it's probably worth playing. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this to RPG fans at all."
4200,6,Love the game no complaints!
4201,2,This game keeps you playing.
4202,12,Great game with a good story
4203,4,"very good game, better then most 80$ games nowadays"
4204,12,"solid game but unfortunately, red dead 2 has set the bar too high"
4205,11,"Fun combat 2/5, puzzles too ez 2/5, shit main story 1/5, nice views tho 3,5/5. Overall fucking cringe. Felt like autist Cristopher Robin while petting those little cute monsters. Not worth it if you are grown man and not retarded"
4206,16,you can pet cats :]
4207,5,"Even though I´m not a real Harry Potter fan, this game is fantastic. The maps and scenarios are carefully made and to play it, is pure joy."

4212,15,"Great game, about time a game like this was created for Harry Potter fans."
4213,41,69 hours in *wink wink* and this game still got me at full mast
4214,18,"You're a Wizard, Harry!"
4215,3,The world is great and the gameplay meets expectations
4216,4,This is certainly shaping up to be a fun game with an interesting story.
4217,0,Please help the games isn't opening
4218,16,AMAAAAAAZZZZIINNGGGGGGGG
4219,5,Can pet cats. Hundreds of things to do and explore. Would be better if you could play Quidditch. It Expectro Patrunum-ed my social life away so far.
4220,18,besides the b rate voice acting this game is everything ive wanted in a  Hogwarts game. is it perfect...no but compared to alot of games ive played this one really stands out.
4221,4,orgasmic
4222,7,I'm a wizard Harry
4223,17,I'm Loving the game right now!
4224,11,"This simply is a really good game, if you're not HP fan - even better, if you are - you will probably love it. What's worrying are FPS drops on Proton, hopefully this will be patched."
4225,18,Who woulda thought I could air combo mobs like its God of War
4226,15,One of the BEST games ive ever played!
4227,10,goood game
4228,7,it has met all my expectations and gave me goosebumps the first time i played!!
4229,23,brings me back to feelings of childhood
4230,2,there is nothing like it i wanted a game like this for harry potter since i saw the PS2 games and couldnt find the other games it has been so much fun so far
4231,17,"awesome game, so good"
4232,10,"Would highly recommend! great exploration, fun and inviting game-play and countless hours of fun."
4233,5,very good game
4234,10,Very fun! its Hogwarts of course it would be
4235,4,Very nice to look at along with compelling combat
4236,1,"It's really fun for the exploration aspect of it, the spells are satisfying to use. This isn't one of those choose your own adventure type games so keep that in mind. Player dialogue decisions are very limited."
4237,9,"I love it so far.  The storyline is so interesting. By the way, I'm really happy, that we are not fighting Voldemort again. Hogwarts castle looks amazing. I love all this splendor and details."
4238,15,The game is very fun and has some challenge at lower difficulty. I also have not experienced any glitches or bugs in the game. On a side note I bought the game just to stick it to the woke jerks trying to boycott it!
4239,1,Can't tell you how good the game is because its currently unplayable due to stuttering! Avoid until they patch  it.
4240,33,"Absolutely worth it to do one full playthrough. I haven't played more than once tho, so I cannot comment on the replayability factor but I feel like it's going to be pretty poor."
4241,3,its so good
4242,40,Honestly one of the best games I have played in a while. No bugs that cause any real issues and the game play is super fun. Only real issue I have is that the breeding is very basic. The last game that came out and was this good was Elden Ring.
4243,17,"So far love the game, there's some odd dialogue glitches and choices and some odd combat glitches sometimes but overall been an addiction. Hopefully thr company takes this as a first step to something much better and more into the lore."
4244,7,Great game so smooth no complaints
4245,5,it is good
4246,14,This is the best game I have ever spent an extended amount of time on.

4262,19,"Very good game, lives up to its hype!"
4263,14,"Pretty great story wise, some stuttering and weird crashes on pc I expect the developers will be looking into fixing those."
4264,16,I like it
4265,11,"Simply amazing, puts a smile on my face."
4266,5,it's a fun game once you look past the makers of the game it is fun.
4267,2,even with a good computer lag is unreal
4268,6,Great game
4269,1,games poorly optimized needs to be updated ASAP
4270,17,I will have to say Hogwarts Legacy has Awesome graphics and game-play. I also love the open world type of game . Well done Avalanche Software.
4271,27,I'm a what...?You are a wizard. Thank you for fulfilling the dream.
4272,8,[h1] Revelio [/h1]
4273,12,I still haven't been able to find Voldemort's nose
4274,18,One of the best games I've played in a while
4275,46,"its a world full of magic, really beautiful, combat is amazing however enemies are kind of lackluster"
4276,17,Volmedort.
4277,12,all my data was wiped at leval 30 now i need to restart i need help
4278,11,It's like my childhood coming to life!
4279,6,"this game is beautiful. the story line, the characters, the visuals, the little touches of magic that you can interact with just because, the subtle changes to things as the story progresses - i love it so much."
4280,12,great game
4281,4,"Game is extremely beautiful and detailed. I'm not much of a combat player, but I seem to be handling the game pretty well on normal. It's nice to be back home to Hogwarts."
4282,38,funni hagrid
4283,11,Difficult to find an aspect of the game that isn't polished! You can tell this game was made with a lot of love.
4284,37,I cant find the last side quest but almost done everything else
4285,25,"Such a delightful piece of art it is this game. I enjoyed it so much!It has so many things to explore, every single detail very well crafted. Battles are nor repetitive nor easy nor difficult. Puzzles everywhere, a wonderfull experience."
4286,34,overall very good RPG. The feeling from the movies is clearly there. some minigames are quite repetitive but the game play is rewarding. I always want to return to the game.
4287,16,fire game
4288,28,Really good game! A whole 47+ hours and I JUST beat the main game. there are still things to do!
4289,14,other than the clunky flying its pretty solid. loved HP as a kid and this is nostalgic.
4290,27,I have not been able to sink myself into a game like I have with this game since Skyrim. Love it!
4291,1,Aveedee Keedeevreee
4292,6,love the game love hp still hate jk tho got it for a discount tho
4293,7,"Very fun immersive game. Feels like your own adventure with subtle nods to the books. graphics are amazing, combat is fun and challenging, if you play on hard, and story is enjoyable. Hate the way broomstick controls are designed, but only a pain when you race."
4294,16,Wizards Harry. Hairy Wizards.
4295,4,The game to unite generations of Harry Potter fans. 15 year old me would have never stopped playing.
4296,10,Amazing game will not change anything maybe to add multiplayer.
4297,9,"The game is just fun, lots of stuff to do. yeah there are some funny things like glitches that happen, but the same can be said for any game really."
4298,3,"So Happy to finally have a Wizarding world game that's worth playing and captures and satisfies the imagination and allows you to explore Hogwarts, I recommend this game to any and all Wizarding World fans."
4299,10,Amazing game! I'm not a Harry Potter fan but this is probably one of my favorite games from the past few years.
4300,27,has immortal cats.
4301,17,It's pretty damn sweet. You get to live your own little harry potter fantasy. Bonus points for it being a good ARPG as well.
4302,13,amazing combat system + links with pottermore/wizarding world.
4303,17,"This game looks amazing and its very smooth running, even while flying. The battling in the game feels really cool especially when the combos are hit just right."
4304,16,Great game although fairly linear
4305,52,best game i've ever played
4306,18,Masterpiece
4307,7,"Although my laptop keeps crashing, its an amazing game. The graphics and open world are great, and there is SO MUCH to see! Make sure to look at your specs before you purchase and download."
4308,42,Worth the money!

4314,9,Amazing...!!!  I hope they do a MMORPG version of it!
4315,2,dang they made some pretty big renovations to buckingham palace
4316,23,Its so good <3
4317,20,An amazing game. its is truly easy to get lost in it and loose sleep over lol
4318,31,"Ahh king Julien. The boy who lived, come to die.AvaDA KeDAvrA"
4319,7,i had loads of fun on this game!
4320,11,"It's like a very easy Elden Ring where you can only use magic and potions. Very story driven, wish there was more combat."
4321,13,"If you the wizarding world, you will like this."
4322,24,Daily life in Britain simulator
4323,32,Decent game with plenty to explore. Not the most depth to all the features implemented but overall a fun time. 8/10 would recommend.
4324,18,The best open world game with lot of things to do that's non repetitive. 10/10 recommended.
4325,14,"amazing game and deep graphics with overall 10/10 in game play, & story line. Definitely recommending it to anyone who has ever been a fan of RPG and Wizarding world books/movies."
4326,1,This will be game of the year.
4327,14,It's a dream come true! It's definitely the next Skyrim! LOVE LOVE LOVE!

4329,13,"Yeah do it, it's good."
4330,18,cute fluffers
4331,14, A dream became a reality
4332,37,It's the game everyone wanted it to be. Don't need to be a Harry Potter fan to enjoy it. World is full and exciting and main storyline is great. Have finished the main quests and not done playing yet!
4333,54,great game
4334,2,It's like an expansion for the movies!
4335,30,"one of the best triple A game ive played in years , worth every penny"
4336,33,It's worth every penny.
4337,45,One of the best games I've ever played
4338,2,GAme is super fun
4339,2,:) its great
4340,6,Can cast Avada Kedavra
4341,6,best game ever
4342,12,Yep it's fun. Targeting could be better. Wish there was more interactions with animals. Just petting cats is a bit limiting. Cows and Testrals ect. probably like being pet too.
4343,26,"Story and gameplay good, menu's not so good."
4344,15,"Not only for the Harry Potter fans, this open-world action RPG is fun. Engaging combat, great game design, visuals and music. Definitely recommended."
4345,19,best game ever
4346,11,"I love this game and its so nice, but the stuttering, and big fps drops, mainly happening inside the castle, are giving me a head ache, like seriously they affect me, like nausea or something.. every time i try go through a door in Hogwarts is giving me this feeling .. Please fix :("
4347,33,"landscapes look good, minor bugs, repetitive gameplay, low mob/enemy variety, too easy/spamy combat, dull dialogues(I only liked Sebastian and Ominis other NPCS were lifeless so I started skipping a lot), weird XP system that enforces you to 100% the game if you want to hit 40, the ""puzzles"" were fun in the beginnung but were too easy/boring in the long run. lame antagonist/bossfight in the end. overall it was fun/a decent game but not worth the 70€ tbh. get it when its on sale and theres more content. 7/10 game if you have nothing else to play at best more like 6/10. I played it on Hard and 240fps average on ultra my system is 13900k+4090 etc."
4348,14,VRAM hog but love it otherwise
4349,20,i am so happy this game is so good and finally a game that dosent come out broken like sht
4350,10,The Immersion alone is worth the price if you are a fan of the series!
4351,6,"The size of the map, the variety, the fidelity."
4352,11,"Love how fun and entertaining this game is! It's so easy to lose track of time, each quest sucks you in and there is so much to explore along the way!"
4353,27,BIG BURD
4354,22,a very good sequel to elden ring
4355,2,Phenomenal game thus far. Can't wait to see what else it's gonna offer.
4356,28,Epic Games
4357,46,Meaningless choices. Underwhelming important deaths. Great game nevertheless.
4358,7,amazing game. exactly what ive been wanting from a harry potter game!
4359,20,w game shits fun
4360,24,good asf
4361,25,Worth every penny.
4362,3,yassssssssssssssss
4363,6,too dope
4364,43,Extremely fun! I have no words for what it is like to now be in this magical world that ive loved since i was abou 10 years old when the first book came out great Job!!
4365,26,"Sorry, but the Story sucks. It is linear and has nothing to do with RPG. You barely get a choice and most of your actions have no weight. The game is full of plot holes..."
4366,17,Game crashes quite a bit and will no longer launch at all.
4367,2,"Really fun, and a bit addictive. I however wish the combat was a bit easier to perfect without standing there, waiting for them to attack so you can counter/dodge, like Batman games :\"
4368,38,I can live out my eco-terrorist fantasies by casting Crucio on poachers
4369,6,"Never watch any of the movies, but this game is Fantastic :)"
4370,2,Shadow wizard money gang
4371,16,totally recommend it for the hate youll get for playing it. seeing people screech and cry over something is funny
4372,7,good soup
4373,1,Excellent game so far!!!
4374,10,The game is great. I love it so far
4375,6,cant describe and i dont have the time. just play it
4376,2,This is the best fucking single player open world RPG Ive ever played.
4377,2,Exceeding expectations honestly. So far 2 hours in.
4378,17,"Great game, worth it 9/10"
4379,18,I didn't think i'd like it as much as I do. Just buy the damn game already.
4380,11,harry potter fan or not games fun as hell
4381,18,It is what i wanted growing up from a Harry Potter game. I can't recommend this game enough.
4382,22,"lived up to almost every expectation so far, everything 8 year old me wanted and more <3"
4383,9,good game
4384,11,"The game is constantly crashing. Sometimes it crashes in a few minutes of gameplay and sometimes it crashes in under an hour, but it always crashes in the end. I've tried every fix that I've found online, but nothing works. This is the only game in recent memory where it's crashed at all."
4385,6,AVADA KEDAVRA!
4386,13,Transphobic developer.
4387,3,awesome game
4388,39,Incredible game. 10/10 from me. Plays quite well on Steam Deck.
4389,6,very very fun
4390,38,I love how open-word the game is. I've spent hours just doing side quests.
4391,4,Honestly not a huge Harry Potter fan. I wasn't even too excited when the game came out. Then I played it at a friends house and have been hooked ever since! It's a pretty damn solid game so far.
4392,15,"I'm having so much fun with this game, This is everything any Harry Potter fan wanted for years. And I'm quite sure the gameplay is solid enough so that non fans would like it as well.Just ignore the twitter gremlins and have fun."
4393,16,Love it! And since the last patch I have no problems with FPS drops anymore.
4394,22,"If you like the fighting of other WB Games and the stories around Hogwarts, you will like the game"
4395,1,"It's leviosa, not leviosar!"
4396,4,"great game, has a bit of a performance problem"
4397,25,good game
4398,0,Thank you for your game ♥️I will wait for the Ukrainian language with the new DLC))
4399,9,YORE A WIZERD HAARRY
4400,21,Probably one of the best games with a great story-line that I've ever played
4401,12,MADLY INLOVE WITH THIS GAME HOPE WE GET EXP[ANSION PACKS FOR MORE GAMEPLAY
4402,15,This game is great!!! Having a blast. Some quests differ depending on which house you choose. And animagi are in the game {so far only encountered as enemies}.
4403,3,I like it #terfsgetout
4404,9,Great game!!
4405,6,An ambitious game that lives up to the expectations of what an ideal HP RPG should be
4406,20,"The game is fine, but its woke as shit....Hogwarts  is basically run by first generation immigrant teachers...."
4407,0,Potato! or whatever the block spell is
4408,11,one of the best games i have played in a while.
4409,32,Best Harry Potter game all time . The Mandrake are the shit
4410,22,Definitely a Game of the Year contender.  9/10
4411,8,You're a wizard hairy
4412,13,I'm a Straight white guy. I love this game.
4413,2,amazing graphics
4414,19,only fix i see needed is the is the lagging issue with cpu usage in some places
4415,7,is good yes
4416,54,But why can't the others see the thestrals?
4417,3,If you are a fan of Harry Potter and Skyrim then this is the perfect game!
4418,3,"Beautiful graphics! Challenging but not too difficult. You do not need a working knowledge of Harry Potter to play. Although, it helps. ;)"
4419,13,"noice, fun. 10\10 would rate again."
4420,22,Brilliant
4421,27,I haven't had this much fun in years. GOTY right here.
4422,18,great game plain and simple
4423,6,I don't like harry potter but I LOVE HOGWARTS
4424,12,its just simply one of the best games to come out.
4425,0,"Awesome game, love the quality and detail put into it."
4426,16,Sometimes it seems like all roads leads to hogsmead.10/10
4427,4,"Run very bad and stuttery in my PC setup: Ryzen 5 3600 + RTX3070, on every setting level (low, med, high, even ultra)To the point where it became cinematic below 24FPS in some early cutscenes.Really want to love this game.Great game but bad optimization for me.Refunded for now, probably will buy it back later after several updates and a discounted price.Not worth the price when I can't even enjoy a decent experience."
4428,10,fun game. must be played on a fast ssd or m.2
4429,4,"Be wizard, have robes, make wand 14 inches, make it also black."
4430,11,SOMEONE TYOLD ME NOT TO PL;AY IT SO I PLAYED IT
4431,9,"Prretty goood , cool, and fun gam Stick go zaaap!"
4432,2,problems installing then problems updating waste of time
4433,22,"The game is good on so many things, but worse in alot more. I have enjoyed my time, but i dont want this kind of RPG attitude to become the standard because ""hey, 93% of steam didnt think our game sucked, and gave it the thumbs up"" to be a metric of a good game. Do better next time."
4434,3,good game
4435,2,This game is so good especially if you're a harry potter lover
4436,9,Finally a harry potter open world. Loving it. good story too. totally worth it!
4437,4,game of the year
4438,8,great game if your computer is able to run it
4439,17,This game is honestly one of the best games i have ever played.  Not since the release of Red Dead 2 have i been this obsessed with a game and i am not even a harry potter fan.
4440,1,Awesome game!!
4441,14,Stupefying
4442,13,I would sell my body to get more games like this
4443,6,its like i'm 12 years old reading the books again
4444,9,game is super fun
4445,5,Great Game
4446,10,Don't go into the long grass.
4447,9,Best game I've played in a while. If you like story and open world this game is for you. I feel like I won't beat this game for a while and I'm okay with that. The only dislikes I have is the lack of customization regarding player creation.
4448,9,[h1] Prof Garlick's cake tho ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  [/h1]
4449,20,"I rarely play single player games. With that being said I can say this is probably the most fun I've had in a while. The quests, open world, user interface, and puzzles are all well thought out and are challenging. Would 100% recommend!"
4450,16,i wish the evil ending involved me taking over the school
4451,7,"Amazing game, runs well, looks good, and the gameplay is fun. Ubisoft needs to take notes from this. Rarely do I find rpg games this fun. For me it's a 10/10 masterpiece."
4452,22,ITS AMAZING
4453,18,fantastic
4454,8,fantistisk spil. thumbsup
4455,10,Its a really good game with LOADS of things to keep you busy and a good story
4456,12,You're a wizardI'm a what?
4457,16,"not even a HP fan, but this game is amazing."
4458,3,"Really good but can't kill other students, L"
4459,7,Estou amando!
4460,21,"Me gusta la variedad de cosas que puedes hacer mientras avanzas en el juego, las peleas con varitas son brutales."
4461,20,"(Please read the bottom for the reason for thumbs down.)Hogwarts Legacy went beyond my expectations when coming from a studio that, on the surface, only looks like they made bad mobile games. It's extremely fun with a spell combination system for magic that encourages mixing and trying different spells to excel in combat and parrying. Everything is flashy and interesting. The visual design and effects of the world and world is exciting. The first time you walk on moving stairs is a treat.Honestly, I only have surprised praises for how good this game came to be.So I will only list two complaints since you probably have a good idea how great the rest of this open-world RPG is. There are two major things holding it back. The first is easilyPerformance.Due to some questionable coding in Unreal Engine, the optimization of this game likes to violently shake from working smooth as butter and other times it can drop even lower than 15 fps. When this happens seems to be random as some areas in Hogwarts run perfectly fine and then will absolutely start to stutter. Same with the forests, towns, they seem to start to fail to run well at most times. Going into your menus and back into the gameplay seems to 50/50 fix this. Normally this isn't a big deal, although it will sometimes start happening when transitioning into a cutscene which kind of completely ruins the immersion or care when it looks that bad.Other, more important times, is where a scene or moment transitions into combat and it happens. Times and paying attention are important the game stuttering heavily to 15 fps doesn't feel good.My other complaint is that there doesn't seem to be enough for replay value. Now, this isn't such a big deal since the game is massive and has lots to do. Though, it seems like the original design had more planned for it and seems strange when playing and seeing that one playthrough wont be different from any other. Most of your choices are aesthetic only and that's not speaking of character creation. Things like choosing your house to your wand creation have no impact really on story or how you play. The wand aspect was a huge disappointment for me as it meant, no matter what, every play through of the game would feel exactly the same in combat. It feels like taking out a personal touch of freedom and creativity is impacted on you when you will be using the same spells and basic attacks in the same fashion no matter what.As well, story elements are essentially the same on multiple playthroughs. There isn't impactful choices or a morality system so however you play will always result to Point A to the ending Point B. This isn't a major issue, but seems quite strange that a game that allows you to make your own character with many choices of creation, equipement design, and everything else combined is relegated on a monorail style of character personality and story. It is pretty linear and the linearity is felt stronger the longer you play. It also doesn't help that choices that are there are meaningless. Learning forbidden magic, wand creation, and dialogue have little to no change at all. Although the illusion of meaning is there, it feels a little disappointing that it is shallow.Overall, though, the game itself is large with lots to do and a Harry Potter story that actually feels engaging and interesting. Characters are great albeit there DOES feel like a slight disassociation from you and your classmates and doesn't give this perspective of your bonding or knowing these people. They just happen to be around and talk to you when you're needed. Which serves what it needs to do. It just damages their roles as being written as characters while making you feel more detached as a person yourself if it doesn't relate to you being a great magic user with special powers. Luckily, this is overshadowed by the rest of the world. Everything related here is mostly nitpicks that, if paid attention to, could make it feel like a perfect game. Yet these little small faults here and there just hold it back at just being ""Great"" and that is by no means a bad thing.((EDIT: Currently due to optimization, most PCs even on the high end have performance issues that happen at any and every point at random. They are massive FPS drops that can even occur at moments of combat and available guides/fixes require having to do changes beyond just the built in setting's menu such as altering .ini files. This is not an acceptable state to have your game in and these performance issues negatively impacting both regular experience as well as the challenges of puzzles/combat in order to progress can be game breaking for some. Changing settings from Higher/Lower does not affect this and some have stated specifically explained how exactly the game creates large memory leaks at these given points. This game is fantastic, but I can't recommend it until this is fixed. Especially since what DOES work functions extremely well on even medium/low end PCs.))"

4463,23,Wizard Balls
4464,18,This game deserves game of the year for 2023. It's the most immersive experience i've had from a video game in years. The world looks amazing and the combat system is incredible
4465,2,"Everyone my age grew up loving Harry Potter. I remember waiting for the new books to come out, reading them in a week, and then talking about them with my friends and teachers for months. The movies were the highlight of my childhood. I was waiting for a game like this.Not like this. Every aspect of the environment and story was hacked to bits, flayed alive to be sacrificed on the altar of diversity, inclusion, and equity. DIE, it did. 1850's Britain, and there are open lesbians walking around in broad daylight? The ministry of magic, who reports to queen Victoria, the head of the Anglican church, can not possibly be unaware of homosexuality in Hogwarts and the surrounding villages. Transexual bartenders when medical theory was based on miasma? Most people could not survive giving birth, much less replacing sexual organs. Which is more magical; performing a surgical transplant on the genitalia, or surgically transplanting 2023 twitter culture into 1850's Britain? I'm sad that creativity has died, and from it's grave sprung cold political idealism and rote mantras of political alignment.As a game, it's nothing special. Nothing like the Witcher 3, which surpasses visually, mechanically, and thematically. If this game had anything going for it, it was nostalgia. Nostalgia cannot be maintained with such a fierce barrage of modern political indoctrination.For the leftists: i understand that you must now attack me, for the sake of acceptance of your tribe. If you don't, they will question your loyalty. Please start your comment with an ***, so that you can get your public proof of loyalty, and I don't have to waste my time."
4466,22,LOVE THIS GAME SEBASTIAN IS SO CUTE RAHHHHH AND I LOVE MY CHARACTER AND THE GAMEPLAY IS SO FUN AND I LOVE FIGHTING PEOPLE
4467,24,Great RPG for Harry Potter fans.

4469,17,Game of the year
4470,8,Felt the fun and intrigue of being in Harry Potter world in a while after my first-time watching the movies.Thanks!!
4471,35,"Great Game! Took me 60 hours for 100%. Story could be a bit better and the ""school-life"" isn't really there but it is a wonderful crafted world."
4472,6,"Sehr rundes Spiel, coole Story und tolles Kampfsystem... Nur in und wieder ein paar Grafik und Audio Fehler"
4473,9,"Great game! Love the storyline, but also love the visuals and mechanics."
4474,24,just play and enjoy good game
4475,6,It feels like you're in a Harry Potter movie. That is enough for most people to enjoy this game.
4476,2,Holy god its amazing
4477,2,Little laggy but thatll depened on your computer componets otherwise the combat is amazing and i highly recommend this game.
4478,2,"I am really enjoying the game so far. It does seem a little slow in the beginning after the intro. The first challenge I did really bad at but the story made out that I did good, it could use some polish on the code for more accuracy."
4479,10,Freaking awesome game.
4480,13,If you get bored you're playing the game wrong.
4481,10,good game
4482,4,awsoooome

4485,2,Game deleted itself after saying it was updating. I got got
4486,2,GREAT GAME
4487,29,This game will go down as a great example of a true RPG. The fantasy and world are amazing and done perfectly. The spells are rewarding in both effect and display. I have no complaints about the game and hope to see more games from this development team.
4488,49,Magic pixels nice
4489,6,"A remarkable game - so much fun to be had and I'm not even a Harry Potter fan. Performance on the Steam Deck isn't amazing, the default settings use horrible upscaling, but on my decade old i5 CPU, 16GB RAM and 1660 Super GPU, performance and visuals are great."
4490,26,"If you're a fan, you will absolutely love this game."
4491,9,"Really enjoying the combat, different enemy types need different approaches, which forces you to use your wide spell arsenal.The whole world is as magical as you'd expect too."
4492,38,gaem guod %_%
4493,13,if you grew up with harry potter you will like this. Its not an elden ring but a really good open world game.
4494,4,"Runs like dogshit, damn another one.... If you are sensitive to stuttering like me avoid this game wait for big sales. Every patch so far they promise performances fixes that do nothing besides making the game look worst and perform the same??RTX3080i9-9900kf32GB of ram Everything overclocked."
4495,2,it says i have 4 hours of play time invested in the game. truth is that's 4 hours of crashing on loading screen. as an avid gamer for 20 years i expect a few bugs here & there but this is too much. i have scoured the internet & tried fix after fix & still no luck.  I would say save your money till it's better optimized for PC.
4496,30,"I love this game. There is a ton of stuff to do and unlock. The graphics are awesome. The combat is really fun also. Story so far is good. I find myself just flying around Hogwarts on m,y broom taking in the view."
4497,28,The best Single Player game i have played since Modern Warfare 2.

4499,35,Best game ive played in years. Actually feels like a finished product

4512,1,great game
4513,3,"Only thing I don't like is most of the time, the game does not want to start up and work when I press to play it. I don't know how to fix that. Otherwise it's a beautiful game :)"

4527,12,"Fantastic adventure game, even better if you already love the world it's built on."
4528,10,Very enjoyable
4529,2,Best Harry Potter game I've ever played. Amazing map and ability to go anywhere. You can explore all of Hogwarts and attend classes. Cool.
4530,22,Excellent open world and very addicting. The castle is so exceptionally well made it is mesmerising to just walk around and look at even the most minuscule details.
4531,2,so far not a bad game
4532,5,the game can be glitchy and patches seem to take a while but its otherwise great
4533,2,blew up my pc
4534,19,"Always loved Harry Potter series, so this game is for me. Its has fun atmosphere, big map to explore, lot's to do and nice combat experience with different spellcasting combos to learn."
4535,0,This review was sponsored by the Shadow Government
4536,13,"Combat is really fun and challenging. Flying is a great experience, though i was expecting directional control using the mouse. Love that your character speaks, kinda rare in RPG's."
4537,19,its secretly a farming/ranching sim ;)
4538,7,hut hut hut hut hut its gud
4539,19,"Its fun. Some bits could be better for immersion, for example night time everybody vanishes etc. but over all its just a fun game. DLC would be a good opportunity to improve missing feature such as quiditch over all i would say 8/10."
4540,3,The current state of the game is unplayable with constant FPS drops and poor framerate everywhere.
4541,13,gta but a wizard
4542,20,"While not the ""Hogwarts Life Simulator"" a lot of people were hoping for, it is still great game.Suffers from some general open world game issues and a serious case of ludonarrative dissonance, but it is undeniably fun."
4543,21,i can commit wizarding war crimes
4544,24,"So much for that boycott, amiright? Best game of the year! Love using the Shrek broom mod, really adds character to the already magical world. 10/10"

4546,0,Good Game
4547,15,"I have it under good authority that my purchase of this game caused a bunch of trans people to Thanos Snap out of existence.If this was any of your loved ones, I am deeply sorry...but the game is pretty good and I wanted to play it."
4548,25,Absolutely adore this game! It's better than I could have imagined!
4549,8,Do not be bullied by the group think mob. This game is amazing. 100% worth the buy even if you're not familiar with the Harry Potter universe.

4553,6,Wonderful Game. Feeling like Harry Potter.

4563,18,very good
4564,13,you can pet the cats
4565,18,"Bought the game, I have 30 hours on it and it is simply a wonderful game. I don't have the required CPU/driver so it lags a bit (even on low settings) but it is still a fantastic game."
4566,3,honestly never watched the movies or anything but i loved the game as much that ive played and im about 5.2 hrs into
4567,9,"Almost a 70/30 split on the ""Hogwarts"" experience to a bounce house GTA.  Decent side quest range and other non-main quest distractions to get into.  Probably expect one or two DLC quest packs and 40+ cosmetic DLCs to nickle and dime you."
4568,19,"Highly recommend the game for any harry potter lover out there! Good story, fun gameplay, visually stunning! GIVE IT A TRY and honestly from a person that is trans.. screw the woke mob xD"

4583,24,"Good, long. Normal difficulty is too easy so i suggest using hard"
4584,13,Great game to experience the wizarding world. Love the game so far and highly recommend
4585,36,best game ever
4586,8,Game is great. Lots of fun. Looking forward to some expansions and the inevitable MMO.
4587,6,very good. nothing else to say
4588,18,"might be nostalgia but i love this game a lot, havent spend nearly as much time in any other game recently"
4589,13,"nothing in this game is mind-blowingly perfect, HOWEVER the fact that they managed to make the combat as fun as it is; that is an accomplishment!!!"
4590,3,So satisfying to play! Exploring the castle is the best part so far.
4591,28,Honestly its one of the best games ive played in ages.
4592,7,Good game
4593,8,Every Harry Potter fans wet dreamEveryone crying about optimization; thats a you problem tbh
4594,5,Finally a game that lives up to the hype!
4595,25,"Lacking in some areas, but incredibly evocative and obviously lovingly made. Very excited for a sequal and absolutely recommend it to anyone interested in the Wizarding World."
4596,43,"nothing to review, only 100% completion game."
4597,10,Outstanding game. Very addictive. I love how it captured the HP world.
4598,35,"Professor Garlick is hot AF, 10/10 Game!"
4599,18,very good
4600,12,Super fun. Never read the books but watched the movies comming up and feel like im right in that world. If youre on the fence its worth a try.
4601,23,"Awesome game, so much to do I keep getting distracted!Not any mayor bugs so far either, which is impressive with such a huge game."
4602,18,"Not a fan of the ""Potter-verse"", but this is a masterpiece.GOTY... until Lords of the Fallen launches, of course :p"
4603,2,This game cured my stage 4 melanoma :)
4604,1,"Had to refund, game was unplayable and poorly optimised from freezing and stuttering to deleting save files, you would think the game was coded on scratch."
4605,10,"Potion making doesn't feel ""magical"" whatsoever. Lockpicking does not pause the game and you learn this the hard way. 30% of my time I've spend spamming Revelio to figure where a scroll sound comes from rather than actually playing the game.Game has a lot of lore and details for Potterheads, but falls a bit short on innovations and gameplay."
4606,3,professor snake shouted at me.. house slithering rules!
4607,25,:)
4608,2,it is ok but a little boring
4609,19,"AVADA KAVADRA! PETS! MOUNTS! You're basically Harry Potter, get the game now no cap on god!"
4610,3,Really enjoying this game. I had mostly forgotten about the Harry Potter franchise but this was certainly a mostly pleasant surprise so far.
4611,12,"Badly optimise. Low fps.If you like Harry potter...you might enjoy this game...but just like the movie, i found that I am pushing myself to finish it off....because i paid for it..I would say, grab this game on sale, at 60-75%....everything seems bland on that game..."
4612,28,Happy to have played this game. Truly scratches an itch that I've had since my childhood! I hope there will be DLCs unlocking even more of this game.
4613,6,"The first few hours are okay. The lustre wears off quickly. It's pretty woke.I would suggest waiting for a DEEP discount, like <$20."

4616,55,Good game.

4618,17,"Controversy aside, this game is phenomenal. This is my 11 year old self's dream."
4619,30,"Great game, absolutely a must play for any Harry Potter fan. Easily one of the best interpretations of Hogwarts I've ever seen.Also you couldn't imagine how inconvenient travel was before she invented Floo Powder."

4622,8,Slyzzzzy
4623,11,"I suspect that most of the negative reviews have nothing to do with the game and everything to do with politics, which is sad. It's a great game; people are crazy."
4624,22,Great gameplay and storyline.  DAYS and DAYS of entertainment unlike so many other quest based campaign games of late that you mow through in a weeks time and never pick up again.
4625,4,I'm a wizard
4626,18,"yes, very good"
4627,17,best game ever been waiting for it since announced and not failed to impress.
4628,8,I like it!
4629,28,Broke the mission to pick up the cookie. I opened the lock on the cage before the start of the side quest and during the quest I couldn't open the lock to let them out because there was no lock
4630,24,Good Game 10/10
4631,4,This game is fun to play!
4632,6,"combat is great, exploration is top tier. everyone is adequitley represented. 10/10"

4637,8,"It is so much fun, the combat is amazing and so much fun. I love the open worldliness and the options you can do. My only dislike is the flying controls. It's so awkward and the only thing in this game that's not fluid."
4638,17,L game you cant avada-kedavra fellow classmates
4639,15,Brilliant
4640,35,I am absolutely obsessed and this is the only game I am praying will release as many dlcs as Sims. I will literally hemorrhage money if I need to. Give me more pls pls pls

4654,7,pretty good
4655,22,Extremely addictive and well made game. Sometimes suffers from performance issues but that´s expected with a new big release
4656,31,Super liked the game! Its fun to be one of the Hogwarts Student!
4657,6,"Puzzles in this game are fun, the combat really sucks. Targeting is a joke, which really ruins combat. Time consuming and buggy to change target during battle. Spells cast at enemies who are not targeted. Amazing this game was released with this kind of a problem."
4658,2,wand go nyoom and broom go vroom
4659,8,Lots of thing to do but repeated enemy make it less interesting. Still a decent game tho
4660,15,loving it so far !
4661,4,I haven't played a game that truly enthralled me like this game does since I was a kid. It truly answers so many wants I'm glad I'm here to play after being a life long fan of the franchise.

4670,7,i love it
4671,16,"love the game, fun to play and explore."
4672,14,"There are some minor bugs and performance issues, but all in all a great game. The hours just fly by and there is so much to do. Story is great and some decent characters also."
4673,22,"Stunning visuals, great story and even greater character development."
4674,23,"A charming game. I have been waiting for a long time, now I will play for a long time."
4675,13,The game was amazing. 10/10 on graphics. 5/10 on voice acting. 10/10 world building. 9/10 overall
4676,20,"Very visually appealing with a great open world and combat style.  If you are a Potter fan, you will def love this game."

4682,3,"I'm not even a Harry Potter or wizards fan in general but this game is pretty good. Ignoring the little optimization problems it has(which will probably be resolved ),it's a must buy!"
4683,4,"game runs like absolute shite for some reason on my pc despite having a 3060 and 5600x playing at 1080p low settings. massive fucking fps drops when im just tryna play the game. makes combat almost unplayable at points and is overall shit when it comes to being optimised for pc. like fuck sake, i surely dont need to spend more money on my computer just to be able to play a game at above 60 fps consistently. sort that shit out and ill give it a positive review cause everything else about the game is good. but its almost fucking unplayable on my pc"
4684,6,its a fun game i love the gameplay
4685,26,"I love it, super smooth all around"
4686,4,Revelio simulator
4687,5,top tier
4688,13,"Bought this game and all the books to support J.K. Rowling, her message, and what she stands up for."
4689,12,"I love the game in almost all its aspects, however after the latest update of the game it has broken the performance to the extreme. I was playing it on High with some options on Ultra, but after the update, I can't play the game even on medium settings. For this alone, I do not recommend the game at least until it is fixed, now it is unplayable."
4690,13,"Not even a Harry Potter fan, this game is incredible. Slow-ish start learning all of the basics and spells. Side quests don't feel repetitive at all. Addicting and worth every penny."
4691,15,"Avada Kedavra, what a wonderful phrase.Add Quidditch, k thx."
4692,11,Simply amazing!
4693,2,very very good
4694,10,All my homies hate slitherins :(
4695,13,"Its a good RPG. Has alot of secrets for you to find out. Could have some more customizing choices, but hey, magic."
4696,18,Shockingly good.
4697,19,good game but chugs a lot
4698,2,"I bought the game because the internet people told me not to. I regret nothing, I'm a wizard now."
4699,0,[h1][b] I bought this game just to give big support to J. K. Rowling. [/b][/h1] + I got perfect RPG game.
4700,13,"I'm not too far into the game, but I already love it!"
4701,9,"having some FPS problems with the game but hopefully that gets patched soon, the game itself is an 8/10"
4702,7,You're a wizard Harry!
4703,9,Great game unit it didnt let me progress anymore due to a bug https://www.reddit.com/r/HarryPotterGame/comments/10z8oxu/cant_interact_with_any_npcs_bug_pls_help/
4704,7,This game has made me into a monster. 10/10 would recommend
4705,47,Boring world filled with too many pointless collectables.
4706,18,broom goes brrr
4707,4,Astounding game and great to play.
4708,4,Avidi Kadivi
4709,8,its a well made game and i can use avada kedabra or how ever its written.
4710,8,"Its not my style, if all you want to do is run around and collect things for 50 hours, its your game. there's less than 30 spells that you just run around spamming mindlessly, and it seems they made the world map absolutely massive for no reason other than making you run around more. everyone has their thing, this one is not for me apparently."
4711,5,"I have mixed feeling about this game...One one hand it is simply a piece of art. On the other, it plays like hot garbage.This is one of the most poorly optimized games I have ever played. It doesn't matter how powerful a computer you own or even how low you crank your settings. The game constantly stutters and it is a HUGE immersion breaker. Buy this game in a year once they have hopefully patched it enough to actually run."
4712,3,A W E S O M E
4713,2,"This game is amazing. Enough said. If you like Harry Potter and video games, play this. Play it now.BE CAREFUL BECAUSE IT'S ADDICTING"
4714,54,been a blast for me
4715,10,"Got on the best game ive played in a while today, just to find all of my local and cloud saves have just disappeared. definitely going to not enjoy losing all that progress!"
4716,9,Shadow wizard money gang we love casting spells
4717,13,its pretty awesome
4718,15,Only negative is everyone in game talks like Hogwarts is a prep school
4719,7,"very fun, professer garlick is bad as fuck"
4720,10,"Friend: ""Dude where are you?""Me: ""Shopping at Hogsmeade""Friend: ""Herbology class is about to start""Me: *I am speed"

4724,52,UM YES!!!???
4725,22,great game
4726,13,Game is good and fun!
4727,2,"Fun game! What's the deal with the ugly bartender at Hogsmeade, though? Looks like the devs also screwed up the pitch for the voice with this character."
4728,8,Loving it so far!
4729,33,Amazing game!   For anyone who likes open world and magic you're in for a treat!
4730,13,1. Buy.2. Enjoy.
4731,15,Everytime I get a dialogue from Sinora Ryan I would always close my eyes and get an erection.
4732,48,Reallygood!
4733,20,You wouldn't believe how inconvenient travel was before I invented Floo Powder!
4734,3,"As a open world, it has a lot to offer. Not to technical but satisfying. Aside from the crying over this game. It's awesome and I highly recommend this game. For HP fans and open world fans."
4735,10,This game has a real problem. I need sleep but the game needs me to play it. So....I'll just play this and not sleep.
4736,33,Finished the game :/
4737,9,"i love the mechanics and the story line of the game, would recommend to anyone who enjoys harry potter and rpg games for sure"
4738,7,im a transphob
4739,3,I am honestly enjoying this more than God of War 2
4740,7,Endless entertainment
4741,33,I love the amazing graphics and open world that goes into INCREDIBLE detail! The puzzles are fun and simple! The game has a great way of rewarding your achievements and I truly feel like a witch while playing this game!
4742,31,The combat system is interesting and very dynamic. The story is interesting. The game is also quite long.
4743,3,"Love the game.Some bugs, performance issues but overall great experience !9/10"
4744,19,its a very fun and well made game 5 stars
4745,9,"Beautiful game with a nice combat system, main story was rather short, but there are a lot of side quests and things to do in the open world."
4746,32,Fun Game :)
4747,21,♥ big titty goth witches in every class ♥
4748,39,Long Gameplay. Amazing Battle encounters. wish they would make multiplayer
4749,15,Good game hope to see more updates or a dlc
4750,12,"It's perfect down to last detail. Graphics are stunning, story is amazing, a lot of exploring and solving puzzles. Runs great on rtx 3060 with raytracing on.cons-transgenders and lesbians in wizarding world"
4751,2,it is the best Hogwarts Game to date
4752,8,"bought this game because of the boycott, but I'm enjoying the game quite a bit."
4753,15,it is good
4754,7,"They didnt do shit, It WAS playable I got 90fps in the village, not Hogsmade this other small, I didnt had any textures flicks, and ofc there were some stutters after changing location but it was playable, NOW after UPDATE its much WORSE. 45fps in the same location, and stuttering everywhere. I love HP books, and movies. Even bought this game as soon it was pre-relased and it was FUN, and hype for it UNTIL now. It's over. Time to wait for future update with hopeless that there gonna be atleast good. SHAME"
4755,41,AVADA KEDAVRA
4756,11,Game is amazing!!!
4757,51,I absolutely love this game! It had a few bugs but nothing game breaking and it didn't change my experience. I'm excited to see what they bring to the game with dlc's. I plan on playing through again soon.
4758,32,it is sooow good
4759,26,Very good
4760,2,Game runs like shit. I want a refund. I'll wait to buy when this game is sub $20 in a year
4761,23,best harry potter game ive ever played
4762,13,its good
4763,10,if you're a harry potter / JK fan you will love this game.If you're not a fan then I think this game is still a pretty dang good RPG.
4764,2,Unplayable always crashes
4765,24,"Leaving a positive review to combat the social rejects asylum. Great game, horrible ""community""."
4766,10,"About a dozen hours in, so far I haven't enjoyed an open world RPG of this type so much since Witcher 3."
4767,24,"I'm not a single player game kinda person and I hate spiders, but I still would play this game. I might even replay it again."
4768,44,Awesome gameEnvironment 10/10Brooms 7/10Flying Mounts 4/10Graphorn 9/10
4769,15,10/10 game. Overall a great play style and in depth view in the wizard world. The only downside is the optimization problem for PC.
4770,12,"Amazing game its that simple, explore, fight, choose your path in this amazing RPG"
4771,5,"great gfx, brilliant story line, keeping true to the wizarding world"
4772,13,most crashy and buggy game ive ever played. the game play is fun sure but half the time i cant enjoy the game because its either crashing or i cant unlock something anymore because of a crash. My pc is not bad its actually top of the line and it still crashes. i tried everything to get this game running without crashing but nothing worked.Pc specs:i9-13900k3080ti32gb of ram ddr5overclocks turned off to see if that was causing crashes but didnt solve anything
4773,24,professor Garlick
4774,29,BEST GAME I HAVE PLAYED IN YEARS! I WISH I HAD THE MONEY TO BUY TEN COPIES! WORTH EVERY PENNY! AND THE UPSET SJW's ARE JUST THE ICING ON A DELICIOUS CAKE :) I URGE EVERYONE TO GET THIS GAME :)
4775,14,Needs better optimization
4776,5,It's a good looking gameOverly long tutorialUnusual way to get most experienceClunky combat for pc and casting the reveal spell all the time sucksMultiple crashes and bugs and now the game won't launch after patchI want to like it more but I'll give it a 5/10 for now.It'll get better but it is better to wait a while to let them get some decent patches out.
4777,18,You're a gizard warry
4778,3,Hogs have warts O_o
4779,25,"Simply put, it is fun to play and looks fantastic.I wish I didn't need 12GB of VRAM to max out the graphics, but that is a personal problem."
4780,11,"I have completed the story 14 missions total, several of them with some blocks that forced me to complete secondary content. While most people had terrible performance and is true that in my case I also had bad moments with it, I was able to complete it in 19h.Honestly the story is quite simple, the stakes are there but it really doesn't feel good and every dialogue choice doesn't really matter on the development of the main story only how the individual dialogue develops.Performance is even after the patch, not great. I had big stretches where I was able to play at 60 fps at 3440x1440 (ultrawide) with most settings at ultra, a few on high and DLSS at quality. But i had several drops to the 40fps and many to the 50-55fps with quick recovery. I believe most developers nowadays are trusting in technologies like DLSS and FSR to carry them the rest of they way and skip on optimisation. Sadly this is not the way in my honest opinion as a developer myself.The game clearly needed more thought and time. We know the first impression is important and this game is only selling because the IP it carries. It is fun to play for a bit, it makes feel like a wizard yes, but sadly it becomes monotonous towards the middle and is just tedious towards the end. Cooldowns in this case are more annoying than anything else, you base damage can be improved but towards the end many big enemies take forever to take down without the actual spells. Some missions have spells requirements which I understand as they are needed for completing certain sections but level requirements are useless on the easier difficulties. I can easily deal with a dozen enemies 1 or 2 levels above me and it won't matter. At least if your spells and attacks are combined right and your are playing on the easiest difficulty.Again, the game is not bad. I really don't care about the drama about JK. I don't care about seeing more black people. I don't care the sexuality some characters.  I care about the work and this work is currently average for me and for many people is quite unplayable. So no. I don't recommend it. Wait until the performance is fixed and it is on sale. Perhaps then you will be able to enjoy it better."
4781,3,It's good
4782,15,amazing game
4783,3,Game runs like a 1978 buick sylark right out the junk yard 10/10 would recommend
4784,26,This game is absolutely amazing
4785,17,too laggybut that aside its good
4786,19,"Great game. only complaint is there isnt any quidditch, but im sure thats to come in a future dlc....... 10/10"
4787,6,Great game
4788,28,litty titty in the city
4789,24,"One of the best tripple A games in a while. People who haven't seen the movies or read the books should also enjoy the game. Surprisingly active and fluent combat, variety of activities, so far worth the price."
4790,7,everything you want and more!!!!
4791,0,"At first I stuck at epilepsy warning, crash and burn. Then after 14th Feb update I was finally able to get the game to load up but still crashing during the shader screen. There is no point to wait for a fix, gonna refund.https://hogwartslegacy.bugs.wbgames.com/bug/HL-182"
4792,2,amaazing!!!
4793,3,No bad things to say. It's awsome!
4794,6,"You're not gonna be playing a videogame, you're playing an interactive cutscene simulator with the occasional recycled combat loop for a few minutes sprinkled around. That being said the story is worthwhile and the game is enjoyable."
4795,52,"Absolutely fulfills the wizarding world fantasy, worth the buy 100%"
4796,8,"JUST AMAZING!! I would highly recommend hogwarts legacy, it truly does make you feel your actually in hogwarts."
4797,7,"Wicked awesome game! A little on the short side, but overall amazing game!"
4798,5,I LOVE IT
4799,13,Best game my husband and I have played in a long time. It resembles Skyrim but with a Harry Potter Twist. We really LOVE this game!
4800,27,words cant describe the fun xD
4801,15,Looks incredible
4802,5,"incredible game, 1 of very few games that im hooked on"
4803,6,Very good game - coming from someone who was not too crazy about Hairy Potter.
4804,18,"A truly great open world game, especially so if you are a fan of Harry Potter"
4805,19,"Fantastic Open World RPG, Still has new game bugs. Do not recommend to those with low Spec PCs. Hope the developers reintroduce the Curfew Rules of Hogwarts as that would greatly improve the immersion of the game world."
4806,6,ratio
4807,7,great game. we need more games like this it keeps are focus
4808,18,The sidequests can be a bit tedious but on the whole it's fun. I like turning acromantulas small and squishing them.
4809,3,SHADOW WIZARD MONEY GANG
4810,18,great but bugy if u dont have a nice pc
4811,24,its good
4812,31,Everything's so pretty

4814,13,Turn off steam cloud it deleted 22 hours of progress
4815,9,Living in one of my dream worlds. Love it <3
4816,16,Why this game called harry potter if harry potters isnt even in it 3/10
4817,25,Goated game
4818,19,"Completed the game, amazing"
4819,7,"Great game. I recommend buying it on every platform available to you, separately."
4820,6,Wingardium leviosaaaa
4821,6,Love it!
4822,12,"There's no role-playing. You choose your house, the color of your hair, and that's it. Click here and go there, that will be 60 euros for you sir! Dev completely missed the point. If I had wanted to play Assassin's Creed, I would have played Assassin's Creed. Jeez even the mobile game is better..."
4823,47,Excellent game. The details are exquisite- the storyline and quests are awesome as well.
4824,4,its pretty good
4825,17,WOW! This game is incredible. Very rarely do your expectations of a huge release be met and this game has met every expectation I had and then some. There is so much to do and explore.
4826,10,我終於可以和女人說話了
4827,27,This game is worth it 100%. Fuck Cancel Culture
4828,14,i like it :)
4829,26,"This should be a good game. However, I've spent more time troubleshooting issues than I have playing it. Countless audio, visual, and gameplay related bugs. Permanent crackling audio fixed, then deal with my character blurring all over the screen, fix that deal with broken lighting that makes it so my whole screen is blinding, fix that run into broken questlines.Like the game is good, but I don't have the patience for this shit. However, I know it's 2023 and we expect games to not work, so if that's you're expectation then it's totally a buy."
4830,18,SOLID GAME
4831,6,very addictive
4832,3,"the game runs like absolute crap , the game itself is amazing however  its lagging and unplayable people with worse pcs spec wise have no issues however i am seeing threads and threads of people with the same issues . honestly a huge waste of money and a potluck if it'll actually run"
4833,6,"i would recommend you to play this game it is vedi good vedi nice, also nice to sit and eat chinese food during cutscenes."
4834,6,hell of a game i recommend 100%
4835,10,Do yourself a favor and play this game. It hits all the nostalgia feels while delivering a fun combat system. Plus you can dress up. What's not to love?
4836,6,Beautiful and very interesting. Welcome to Hogwarts!
4837,17,"Great main story, lots of fun side quests"
4838,9,"An amazing title! Cohesive and overall accurate playable world. Only complaint, no playable Quidditch. :'("
4839,38,The ultimate wizarding world expirience.
4840,7,I'm a Dark Wizard Finally.
4841,24,This game is sooooooooooooo good I played it for 40 hours in 5 days while going to uni and while going out. It is soooooooo goooooooood I choose to give up on my proper 8 hours of sleep schedule to just play it. RIP my sleep schedule
4842,2,apart from the lag its a juicy game
4843,12,best game ever but it needs optimization
4844,9,u become wizard woosh woosh alakazam kebabom good game rate 10/10 must buy nice
4845,20,"I love love love this game!! I'm so happy to be able to play! Please keep expanding and developing more for the game, because I would love to continue playing for a very long time!"
4846,7,Beautifully designed and textured game! Very fun and immersive experience.
4847,3,"Fun, Hogwarts and actually compelling mechanics!"
4848,7,Fun game design; really immersive if you're a Harry Potter fan.
4849,2,Transphobic 😎
4850,10,tbh play wizard101 instead
4851,15,#NAME?
4852,9,I Wizard
4853,15,Tons of fun!
4854,34,good detailed needs more real content because the game is short
4855,2,Merlins beard i just cummed
4856,11,Game breaking bugs. i'm close to just uninstalling and never playing it again.
4857,6,The game might be slow but the hogwarts experience is worth it
4858,13,you can make a chicken levitate
4859,15,Amazing Game. One of the best I have ever played but can be glitchy sometimes.
4860,4,You seriously don't even need to be a fan of harry potter to enjoy this game. Its genuinely a marvelous experience and a great take on the Open World genre.
4861,6,Will write a better review later.  Too busy playing.  10/10 game.
4862,2,Game Black Screens on launch. No official Nvidia drivers. $80 down the drain and cant even play.
4863,18,good shit
4864,11,Been waiting for a game like this for years. I love the way it turned out!!
4865,24,Based game and based JKR. It's fantastic!
4866,6,This game has definitely lived up to the hype! There are a couple of small bugs but it doesn't take away from the experience at all.
4867,10,"Ooh, piece of page..Ooh, piece of page..Ooh, piece of page..Wait, what was I doing again?"
4868,33,Play it only if you really like the books or the movies it's the definition of an average game. :D I had fun tho
4869,20,"This game is amazing... Great story, good combat - well worth the buy. Graphics are good and it finds a good balance between story and combat. Definitely recommended!"
4870,5,good gamevery fun
4871,8,Great game. Really getting into the universe. It is extremely enjoyable.
4872,1,"Great idea - bad implementation.Pre-ordered this, deluxe edition an all. Game comes out, terrible performance despite my machine vastly exceeding the requirements. Horrible FPS in hallways in the school and just about every cut scene no matter if the graphics are set to Ultra or Minimum. Can't play so I wait. Devs patch the game saying performance should be better. I load the game back up, issues still present. I quit the game. And wait some more. Another patch - performance issues supposedly patched again. Load the game back up once more....still the same issues. I'm done. I returned this game for a full refund. 0/10. I'm not playing this game with the devs."
4873,11,One of the best gameplay experiences I've had since Witcher 3
4874,10,Amazing!
4875,3,Yes. Its an amazing game and it shows.
4876,14,Incredible Game that everyone can enjoy. Holds special meaning for Harry Potter fans that elevates it to legendary status and does the world we grew up loving justice
4877,22,"I will start with - this is the first and last game I have ever pre-ordered. I was so hyped about the game after all these years - a Harry Potter game with modern graphics. I will point out the bad sides first. 1. The game is dashingly predictable. The story is boring (SPOILERS!!!), I am the ultra young hero that defeated and killed wizards with muuuch more experience than me. Sure. Booooring. 2. I start from 5th year and I miss all the fun from the beginning, all the spell learning, classes, etc. 3. Every single NPC besides the ones for the quests, feel like the training dummies I test my magic on. They do not feel living, they kinda just stay there, like cardboard characters. 4. This should must've been a MMORPG game, where we start from 1st year, learn, duel each other, form teams, eventually story unwinds that Hogwarts will be attacked eventually, we participate in different events where we learn newer and newer stuff, the years go by, we get better and better, whole game goes darker, more enemies spawn, attack us, lure us, etc. Eventually we get to a point where we have to defend Hogwarts and if we fail - then we have to retake it. All of us should've had our own paths, become herbalists, beast masters, potion maters, etc, fight with what we chose, explore the world, gather, learn. Have different character personalities - like being bad or arrogant, or good, or selfish, etc. 6. Game becomes repetitive fast, especially with all the cut scenes that you cannot cancel (like Merlin trials) - it gets annoying. 7. The whole world feels... small. Yes, there's lots to explore, but it gets the same after some time. Spiders, inferni, some water enemies and loalists. That's it. Few trolls and few wolves. 8. The game is badly optimized for PC, it works, but it requires a lot of hardware to be ran on maximum graphics where you do not get much better graphics, to be honest. 9. Conversations are dull, you cannot make proper conversation, it's very straightforward and there are ""choices"" that do not affect anything of the end game. 10. All the teachers are bad copy from the teachers of the HP saga, visually and character like. 11. If it was a 10$ game - it would be okay. But 50-70$ game - it's definitely not worth the money,Overall - meh. It's playable, it's just not what it could've been - a masterpiece. Now it's just another game we will forget in several months."
4878,11,makes you feel like harry potter
4879,37,"Dream come true for HP fans.Better open-world than recent Ubisoft games.Overall good, wholesome game."
4880,6,You can't imagine how inconvenient travel was before I invented Floo powder.
4881,16,"Really Fun open world game. Has a good variety of puzzles, stealth options, and battles. If you enjoy open world games, exploration games, or Harry Potter you will enjoy this game."
4882,31,"This is a great game, don't let anything take away from that.  If you have moral problems with the game, that is for you to decide.  What I know is that I'm enjoying it and going to play through with each house."
4883,30,your a wizard harry
4884,7,F**k J.K.But the game is awesome!
4885,4,a nice game
4886,2,pog game
4887,39,one of the best single player games ive played in a long time
4888,3,"At the moment, I recommend holding off as performance is quite choppy even on various high end systems. Actual game is fun to explore and whatnot, but the current performance is dismal."
4889,23,Brilliant!
4890,4,"I am not a harry potter fan, I read the books and watched the movies and thought the universe was cool but never really cared about new IPs, games or the spinoff movies. This game makes me want to buy a wizard hat and a wand to really start my wizarding journey"
4891,22,muy guapo
4892,7,Fucking game deleted my saves. Don't buy it.
4893,8,top notch game. plenty of story line as well as a huge open world to explore. 10/10

4895,33,Very niceI agree
4896,7,"Perfection, almost"
4897,26,"An absolute treat of a game. If you are unsure if you wanna get the game, just do it and have a blast."

4905,20,A literal childhood dream come true.
4906,3,Its a cool ass game
4907,62,Assassin Creed Valhalla as a wizard. What is not to love?
4908,19,We love casting spells >:)
4909,10,"It's kinda fun how a game that is so controversial, is so good and well made. I literally can't remember last time a when a game was released and was done and not buggy as all hell."
4910,18,niceuuuuuuuuuuuu
4911,19,what a game!!!!
4912,8,eso mismo
4913,6,"Probably one of the best game ever, there's just such an attention to details. Amazing."
4914,1,You can explore Hogwarts and pet a cat. 10/10
4915,11,Relly good game. Worth the purchase
4916,5,Top shelf game.  10/10 would recommend. 
4917,16,gud game
4918,9,It is much better that it looks! It is an amazing game!
4919,15,Much fun roaming around Hogwarts
4920,3,"Just 6 hours in to the game, but so far I can give it an enthusiastic thumbs up! I will expand my review later, as I get more hours in."
4921,7,its the poggers for sure
4922,21,this is the kind of game fans have been wanting for nigh on twenty years now -- and it is an absolute delight to play!
4923,0,Game simply gives me a black screen. 60 euros for this...
4924,9,Good fun. Hopefully it will get expanded even more.
4925,41,"Field Notes should be visible in the map in the end game in Hogwarts, other than that a great game for completionists."
4926,9,very good
4927,11,it just great
4928,17,"Superg game, superb storyline"
4929,40,"Once you've explored everything and gotten really into it, you find that it's kind of empty..."
4930,4,"Game runs fine for me.  But I'm giving it a negative, because I can't comprehend the amount of controls.  It's too overwhelming.At least, I can manage controlling the uninstall button."
4931,48,"Awesome game, also love the accusations that i am trans-phobic that come with the game. Best feeling ever, i definitely recommend the deluxe edition!!"
4932,25,"Terrible story riddled with plot holes and bad character design.Game is overrated because 1. It runs stable for the most part especially when you consider how massive the world is.2. Nostalgia3. Beautiful GameBeautiful game and running smooth seems to be the standard for having a good review nowadays, which is really sad"
4933,15,"Yep, I like it!"
4934,59,Great game! so many side quests will keep you busy for weeks!
4935,24,best game
4936,6,"Already closer to 1/3 of the entire campaign, the number of dialogues begins to tire"
4937,6,Me like.
4938,14,highly recommend
4939,15,Just more than good for Harry Potter fans. I enjoy the story and the world.
4940,16,I have been going through a rough time lately and this game is the perfect escape. Awesome work!
4941,8,good game after long long time
4942,6,RPG at hogwarts.. what's not to like.
4943,24,Worth it!
4944,12,great game a must play for all gamers
4945,7,i like men
4946,13,Loving it.
4947,30,"i just wanted to say that this game is fucking amazing, if you thinking of buying go for it you wont regret it 9/10"
4948,5,truly amazing game not usually my kind of fun but i was pleasantly surprised

4952,37,schgudd'
4953,20,avada kedavra
4954,19,Pretty gud
4955,19,bitchcraft and bigotry
4956,26,"I love the game.  All quest are given with voice and you don't have to read them, which no one really does.The combat is challenging, for me, and there is a variety of fun skills to master.One of the best games I've played."
4957,2,"great game, captures the feel of the harry potter universe, main voices are a little wooden,"
4958,12,Its a very good game
4959,3,"Hogwarts Legacy is fun to play for Harry Potter fans it is a great way to explore the castle and hogsmeade and learn spells, make potions, and the the side quest keep you busy"
4960,14,I am not a Harry Potter fan but I do like the lore and story. But I am enjoying myself immensly with this game. Fantastic overal
4961,28,"The graphics and (annoyingly)unskipable story are enjoyable, but combat, stealth, stealing, minigames, crafting and capturing pets all feel really shallow and incomplete--this game needs lots of patches and good content DLC."
4962,5,very gud
4963,28,its good
4964,49,Gute diese
4965,7,harry potter is the only good thing about rowling
4966,7,I absolutely love the quest lines and the play .... I wish that I could have some better choices for the spellcasting buttons as they are a bit all over the place... (I play on PC)

4969,2,Great for playing with my kid as in her watching me play. My wife thinks its a movie.
4970,10,I enjoy the fact that it is a single player game. If a player decides to cheat he will only be cheating himself and not ruin the experience for everyone else.
4971,9,"Really cool Game so far, I have enjoyed it very much"
4972,4,So legit
4973,0,"So many good reviews, either they love everything that has a harry potter on it or they just have very very veryy low standards.Its the second."

4976,13,"love it. as big as elden ring but one might say its a bit more ""magical"""
4977,16,"Follow butteries, Make potions, explore the castle and ride hippogriff's. 8/10 An excellent trip to hogwarts."
4978,4,"it's a little finicky with the controls sometimes and the view will just start spinning every once in a while, but I think that part of it might be just due to the fact that my computer is not built for gaming so it's a lot for my laptop to be doing all at once"
4979,13,AAA Game that's actually complete
4980,6,Beautiful game
4981,2,Very enjoyable so far. I have not been disappointed.
4982,18,Its the letter we never got.
4983,4,and as Hogwarts game you'll ever play
4984,6,"Everything a Harry Potter fan can desire and then some. As for non Potterheads, it's an amazing open world, role-playing experience."
4985,13,fuck yeah
4986,8,"This game is everything i have ever wanted from this genre. JKR sucks and the creative team for this game is rubbing her nose in it. This is a good, and healthy, way to return to the magic you found in the books and movies."

4991,8,"8/10, amazing game, kinda buggy.I have a Ryzen 7, 16 GB RAM, and an RTX 3070, so the game recommends I run it at High quality, but if I run the game with anything higher than Low graphics settings, it starts skipping frames."
